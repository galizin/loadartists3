STEVIE WONDER LYRICS - Hallelujah I Love Her So




[Words in parentheses () are alternate words, depending on which gender is singing the song.]

Let me tell you 'bout a boy (girl) I know.
He (She) is my baby and he (she) lives next door.
Ev'ry morning 'fore the sun come up,
He (she) brings my coffee in my fav'rite cup.
That's why I know, yes, I know,
Hallelujah, I just love him (her) so.
When I'm in trouble and I have no friends,
I know hel'll (she'll) go with me until the end.
Ev'rybody asks me how I know.
I smile at them and say he (she) told me so.
That's why I know, yes, I know,
Hallelujah, I just love him (her) so.
Now if I call him (her) on the telephone,
And tell him (her) that I'm all alone,

By the time I count from one to four,I hear him (her) on my door.
In the evening when the sun does down,
When there is nobody else around,
He (she) kisses me and he (she) holds me tight.
He (And) tells me "Baby, (Daddy) ev'ry thing's all right."
That's why I know, yes, I know,
Hallelujah, I just love him (her) so.
[Repeat]

STEVIE WONDER LYRICS - The Masquerade




My blue horizon is turning gray
And my dreams are drifting away
Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love
Your love and so is love
I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci and get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci with tears in my eyes
You look the same
You're a lot the same
But my heart says "No, no, you're not the same"
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love
Your words don't mean what they used to me
They were once inspired, now they're just routine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over


STEVIE WONDER LYRICS - Frankie & Johnny




Frankie & Johnny were sweethearts
At least, that's the way the story goes
Frankie bought everything for Johnny
From his sports-car to his Ivy League clothes
Oh, he was a man allright,
Oh, but he was doing a-wrong
Just to show you what came happen

A friend came running to Frankie
Said you know I wouldn't tell you no lie
I saw your man riding in his Jaguar
With a chick named Mary Bley
Oh if he was your man honey
Let me tell you he was doing you wrong
Let me tell the story

Frankie ran around the corner
And peeked in a swinging place
And there she saw Johnny with a woman
He had his arm around her waist
Oh he was a man alright
But Frankie could see that he was doing a-wrong
Oh let me tell you

Frankie reached down in her pocketbook
And up with a long 44
She shot once, twice, three times
And Johnny fell on the hardwood floor
Oh he was a man alright
But she shot him because he was doing a-wrong
But the last thing he told her was

Frankie, you know I love you
Why, honey why did you do that
Frankie, I was telling her about you
Frankie, you know I love you
Frankie, you know that I love you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Frankie you know good well that I love you
Frankie I'll always love you baby
Frankie, you know I can't do without you
Frankie, you know I love you
I'm your man and I know I was doing a-wrong


STEVIE WONDER LYRICS - Drown In My Own Tears




It brings a tear,
Into my eyes,
When I begin,
To realize,
I've cried so much,
Since you've been gone,
I guess I'm drowning in my own tears,
I sit and cry,
Just like a child
My pouring tears
Are runnin' wild
If you don't think
You'll be home soon
I guess I'll drown in my own tears
I know it's true
Into each life
Some rain, rain must pour
I'm so blue
Here without you
It keeps raining
More and more
Why don't you
Come on home
Oh yes so I won't
Be all alone
If you don't think
You'll be home soon
I guess I'll
(drown in my own tears)
Ooh, don't let me
(drown in my own tears)
When I'm in trouble, baby
(drown in my own tears)
Oh, yeah, baby don't let me
(drown in my own tears)
I guess I'll drown in my own tears
Oh, mmmmm.

STEVIE WONDER LYRICS - Sunset




Sunset, sunset
It's sunset, it's sunset

You went and left happy
You're all alone
You turned and walked away
About this time of day
It was always sunset

Sunset
I didn't want you to see me cry
So I turned my head
To hide the tears in my eyes
I turned when evening shadows fall
That's when I miss you most of all

And oh, it's sunset
Oh, sunset

My baby's gone, gone away from me
And now I'm worried taht you can see
