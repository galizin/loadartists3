YES LYRICS - Rhythm Of Love




Innocence no answer
To your breaking heart
If the situation
Sometimes falls apart
Then in this ecstasy
Your charms are frozen
No emotion falling through your arms

Morning, daydream, time still growing shorter
Take me over lead me to the water
To the rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
The rhythm of love

Why should I escort you
To your secret needs
Climbing up your ladder
I keep falling down
Anyway will do
Anyone will do
When you dance to your darkest tune
Surrounded
As you crawl around the room
Night time fever burning till you're higher
Take me over lead me through the fire
The rhythm of love
To the rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
To the rhythm of love

Morning daydream midnight fever
Morning daydream midnight fever
Inhibitions keep you from your point of view
Information needing to confuse
In this situation I have found you
In the rhythm of
Morning daydream midnight fever
Morning daydream midnight fever
Rhythm of love
Rhythm of love
To the rhythm of love
Rhythm of love


YES LYRICS - Big Generator




[verse 1]
Such a strange pre-occupation
Such a strange peculiar breed
How it's shining in its armour
Made of gold and made of steel
It can strike a chord inside you
Like a generation's need
Speaking happy words of promise

[chorus 1:]
Big generator
Lives out of sight
Big generator
Hands upon the wheel

Moving to the left
Movin'
Moving to the right
big generator
moving through the night

Second nature sacrifice
Even if you close your eyes
We exist through this strange disguise

[verse 2:]
I have heard it said to someone
Or maybe it was me
There is a reason to experience
Psychedelic so we could see
To be growing up before us
Like the black and white of love
Be the focus
Be the chorus

[chorus 2:]
Big generator
Hands upon the wheel
Big generator
In for the kill

Second nature comes alive
Even if you close your eyes
We exist through this strange device

Moving to the left
Moving to the right
Big generator
Moving through the night

We are the voices of the big generator

Moving through the night
Movin'

Flying out the soft machine, we offer
All surprise to you
Praise oh praise this anthem generator

Moving through the night
Movin'

We are the voice of every. . .


YES LYRICS - Shoot High Aim Low




We hit the blue fields
In the blue sedan we didn't get much further
Just as the sun was rising in the mist
We were all alone we didn't need much more

So fast this expidition
So vast this heavy load
With a touch of luck and a sense of need
Seeing the guns and their faces
We look around the open shore
Waiting for something

Shoot high break low
Aim high shoot low
Break high let go
Shoot high aim low

This was to be our last ride
With the steel guitar and the love you give me
Underneath the skin a feeling, a breakdown
Well we sat for hours on the crimson sand

Exchanges in the currency of humans bought and sold
And the leaders seem to lose control

Shall we lose ourselves for a reason
Shall we burn ourselves for the answer
Have we found the place that we're looking for
Someone shouted "open the door"
Lookout

Shoot high break low
Aim high shoot low
Feeling of imagination
Break high let go
Shoot high aim low

Shoot high aim low
Nothing you can say
Shoot high let go
Takes me by surprise

Shoot high aim low
Who says's there's got to be a reason
Shoot high let go
Who says there's got to be an answer

We were all alone, we didn't need much more
Shoot high aim low
The sun's so hard on this endless highway
Shoot high let go
Shoot high aim low
I've heard the singers, who sing of love
Shoot high let go
In the blue sedan we never got much further
Shoot high aim low


YES LYRICS - Almost Like Love




Who was it organizing the right
To follow my leader
Seems we look and stand around waiting
For a sign from God
Speaking for myself
The christian need
The muslim need
The buddhist need
To testify the need for brotherly love

I know there's so many hundred things
Things to talk about
Making us laugh
Just like a shakespeare revolution
Please organize our spiritual evolution
Do that you'll feel it
And we'll feel it
Appreciate it's almost like love
It's almost like love
It's almost like love
It's almost like love

Saint or sinner
Makes no difference in who you believe
In a world of superstition
Caught in a total nuclear greed

Pioneers of the twenty first century
Looking on and looking fast
To try and fix and try and help
This very need
I know there's so many ways
That we can work it out
Whether we live or die

Please organize the simple evolution
so there's got to be
so we can see
to be free
It's almost like love
It's almost like love
It's almost like love

So promised in a hundred letters
Should be getting to you any time now
So promised a surprise for you
For getting so far from now
It's almost like love
The way the first one out discovers
It's almost like
How many times can you recover
It's almost

It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like love


YES LYRICS - Love Will Find A Way




You wanna get close to me
The feeling so clear
But I need some time to see
Vision through my tear
You wanna get next to me
I need your intrusion
I don't need to be
Blinded by confusion

Here is my heart
Waiting for you
Here is my soul
I eat at chez nous

Love will find a way
If you want it to
Love will find a way
Love will find a way for me and you

Love will find a way
Love will find a way
Love will find a way
Love will find a way

So you want to get over me
And that's how you feel
Everything you want to be
Seems so unreal
I want to be all of you
And that's the confusion
It's so hard for me
To draw a conclusion

Here is my heart
Waiting for you
Here is my soul
I eat at chez nous

Love will find a way
If you want it to
Love will find a way
Love will find a way

Love will find a way
If you want it to
Love will find a way
Love will find a way

Love will find a way
I believe that there's a way
If you want it to
Will love find a way
Love will find a way
Will love find a way
Love will find a way


YES LYRICS - Final Eyes




Person to person woman to man
Sing me a story to reach me
Teach me to teach me to understand
All these emotions I miss you

So you leave her
Can't believe her
Can't escape
Final eyes
Final eyes

Person to person woman to man
Send me this song that will teach me
Like a river without a stream
Night time without dreaming
Send me this song that will reach me

So you leave me
Can't deceive me
See through me
Final eyes
Final eyes

And I know you think there's nothing
There's nothing more to say
And I know that I've got something
I've got something to say

If ever I needed someone
You were there when I needed you

If ever I needed someone
You were there when I needed you

If ever I needed someone
You were there when I needed you

Person to person woman to man
Send me this song that will teach me
Like a river without a stream
Night time without dreaming
Send me this song that will reach me

So you leave me
Can't deceive me
See through me
Final eyes

And I know you think there's nothing
There's nothing more to say
Don't hide behind the headlines oh yea
I've got something to say

If ever I needed someone
You were there when I needed you
If ever I needed someone
You were there when I needed you

Whenever I needed
Whenever I needed
Whenever I needed

Someone

If ever I needed
Whenever I needed someone
You were there when I needed you

You saved me from falling
Saved me from falling
I'm so in love with you


YES LYRICS - I'm Running




Jacaranda
Help me out tomorrow
Jacaranda
Don't want to be alone
Keep falling over
A spell that brings me sorrow
Give and take
I shouldn't be afraid
So you give me this big story
It wakes me every day
The challenge is to chase the sounds
Just to break away

And I'm running
Running
Yes I'm running
A simple peace
Just can't be found
Waste another day
Blasting all their lives away
I've heard the thunder
Underground
Tunneling away
At the very soul of man

And I'm running
Yes I'm running
I'm running
Through a new world

There is the heart of millions
Seen as a godsend to us
There stands our future
There can be no denying
Simple as A B C D
There stands our children's lives

All in the sharp step
As one together
All in all we race
As one
This time

A simple peace
Just can't be found
Waste another day
Blasting all their lives away
I've heard the thunder
Underground
Tunneling away
At the very soul of man
At the very soul of man

And I'm running
Running
I'm running

See through science
Part of a back door
A door made up of doors
To an endless time
To a new world
Run

There in the heart of millions
Seen as a godsend to us
There stands our future
There can be no denying
Simple as A B C D
There stands our children's lives

All in the sharp step
As one together
All in all we race
As one
This time

Hear this voice
Now and forever
This time, brothers in time
Is it hard to take
Take this coice
Is it hard to find
Now and forever
This fire brothers of fire
Hard to find

As it kicks so hard
Hard to find
As it kicks on time
As it kicks on time

There in the heart of millions
Seen as a godsend to us
There stands our future
There can be no denying
Simple as A B C D
As it kicks so
As it kick so
As it kick so
There in the heart of millions
Seen as a godsend to us

All in a sharp step
As one together
All in all we race
as one
this time


YES LYRICS - Holy Lamb




Holy lamb
See the world we started
Is it so low again
Like a light that's lost upon the stage
So the more it shines, it goes away

Surely then
See the curtain rising to show us once again
All the magic of the earth and the skies
See the more we find
The more we realize

That every time
See the laws of nature keep telling us like a friend
It's the spirit of emotion dancing to the wind
High above
High above
So sure inspired again

I can tell a new story now
Can we see through this mask of uncertainty
Surely now
How can it be so hard when all there is to know
Don't be afraid of letting go
It takes a loving heart
To see and show
This love
For our own ecology

Hold the light
Hold the light
Out of love we'll come a long long glorious way
At the start of every day
A child begins to play
And all we need to know
Is that the future is a friend of yours and mine
