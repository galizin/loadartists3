YES LYRICS - Homeworld (The Ladder)




Nothing can take us far enough emotion
Far enough together
As the light shines so bright
Bright enough to let us in

Nothing can bridge our souls' devotion
Fast enough together
As the power proves you right
Right enough to let you begin 

So many displaced among the future dreamers 
Realized their doubles
Took a new step
A question of origin

Only in the recent past
Seekers fought to realize
Skyward shone like beacons 
A question of origin

Ten thousand millions flee
To the westward light
The dreamers represent
This arc of peace

As the poets entranced
The anchor redeemed
Secrets of science
The history of the future
Was surely made

Just what keeps us so alive
Just what makes us realize
Our home is our world, our life
Home is our world

Nothing can take us far enough emotion
Far enough together
As the light shines so bright
Bright enough to let us in

Nothing can bridge our souls devotion
Fast enough together
As the power proves you right
Right enough to let you begin 

Speak so fast to the prophets of the living
Looking for the signs
Spanning out the centuries
Search for truth

Ancient ones, they watch and listen
Carry our wishes
Took upon themselves to guide us
Through the endless skies

Just what keeps us so alive
Just what makes us realize
Our home is our world, our life
Our hope is our world, our life

I have seen the passion
That's in the hope that everyone
Will find their way into the secret
Of the home of your heart

Living within the vision
Within the power, beyond belief
We see that hate destroys the soul
Of anyone who tries to teach it

I have seen the dream
That's in your heart
That's in your eyes
To bring you closer to the one

It's what keeps us so alive
It's what makes us realize
Our home is our world, our life

Just what keeps us so alive
Just what makes us realize
Our home is our world, our life
Home is our world, our life

Send, ascending to the secrets
All is pure and clear to resolve
Nothing can change us now

Send, ascending to the future
Nothing can ever change us now 
We follow the sun 
We follow the sun
We follow the sun

Truth is a simple place
Here for us all to see
Reach as it comes to you 
As it comes to me
As I will always need you inside my heart

Peace is a word we teach
A place for us all to reach
Sing as it sings to you
As it sings to me
As I will always need you inside my heart


YES LYRICS - It Will Be A Good Day (The River)




Golden forest golden lake
Sanctuary, state of grace
I will find reason a place to begin
It will be a good day

Beginning is one place I've been before
Watching the sunrise on the silver shores
Setting me free again leading the way
It will be a good day

Sometimes I forget
How mighty this earth
Astounding winter skies
Truth is in birth
Peace that it brings to me, my naked eyes
Be a good day

Make me believe again
Making me free again
Making me see again

Golden mountains golden seas
A thousand reasons singing to me 
Alive to this message 
Realising it all 
Be a good day 

Learning to listen learning to see
Learning is power making me free
Free to believe again in my human side
Giving me good reason 
Giving me good reason 

(Come tomorrow)
Make me believe again
(Destiny)
(Take the river)
Making me free again 
(To the sea)

(Come tomorrow)
Making me see again 
(Will be free)

Like a river

Time feels so much closer now
You are with me, so real

We make our own heaven
Clear through the sky
The making of reason for you and I
I sing of each season
Making us feel
This will be a good day
This will be a good day

(Come tomorrow)
Make me believe again
(Destiny)

(Take the river )
Making me free again
(To the sea)
(Come tomorrow)
Making me see again 
(Destiny)
Like a river to the sea

Make me believe again
Making me free again
(Come tomorrow)
Making me see again 
(Destiny)

(Take the river)
Making me free again 
(To the sea)

(Come tomorrow)
Making me see again 
(Take the river)
(Come tomorrow)
(Destiny)
(Take the river)
(To the sea)


YES LYRICS - Lightning Strikes




What you gonna do when the lightning strikes and hits you
Who ya gonna call for the secret of stealing the world
Swimming in this ocean of words on your new cellphone
Diving for the wisdom of pearls in your eyes
Come on

What ya gonna do when the lightning strikes and hits you
How ya gonna laugh when the joker forgets his lines 
Stepping off a cloud into space whatever greets you
Show me how you got this award for being alive

Waking up is waking to the power
Dancing up is dancing till the dawn
Talk talk talk will always get you someplace
Shake it up 'n' shake me till I'm done
Shake it up now!

She ay... Do wa bap
She ay... Do wa bap
She ay... Do wa bap
She ay... Do wa bap

Who ya gonna call when the power
Begins to chase you
Spinning out of shape now you're learning to live again
Fastening your seatbelt tonight it could get jumpy

Showing me the good 'n' that 
Life is not in vain

Take take take 'n' take me thru the lightning
Walk don't talk me always on the run 
Ride it out until you get the picture
Shake it up and let me get me some
Let me get me some

Eya he say touch it together
Touching my spirit touching my feeling
Eya he say touch it together
Touching my spirit touching my feeling
Eya he say coming together
Touching my spirit touching my feeling
Eya he say coming together
Touching my spirit touching my feeling

Talk, talk, talk, keep moving 'round in circles
Moving till the moon is on the run
Take me take me take me to the new day
Take me out and let me get me some

Take take take and dance me thru the lightning
Moving to the left 'n' to the sun... ya ya ya

Help me get me some... ya
Help me get me some... come on

Ooh ya... ooh ya... ooh ya... ooh ya
Ooh ya... ooh ya... ooh ya


YES LYRICS - Face To Face




Here we are trying to mend all the broken hearts
In a world where the pain is the fear
Ain't no doubt there's a method to madness here
Set your clock to the start of a brand new year

Shine your heart to the universe and get the news
Not alone never have been, never will be
See the truth, not to mention the promise made
See them all, see them all high on judar rhythm

We began at the very first spring
How the promise will come when the promise is made
We will sing at the very first spring
That the promise will come when the promise is made
Promise is made, promise is made

Shake me up, take me up
Face to face

Lift me up, shake me up
Face to face

Make me real, make me longing to see you smile
Shall we dancing, shall we be the dancing down under 
In this life of lives, are we ready to take the chance 
Moving to the rhythm, here at last to 

Believe
To believe

We began at the first real spring
How the promise will come when the promise is made
We will sing at the very first spring
That the promise will come when the promise is made

We began at the first real spring - ya
We will sing at the very first spring - ya

We began at the first real spring
We will sing at the very first spring
How the promise will come when the promise is made
Promise is made, promise is made

We began at the first real spring
That the promise will come when the promise is made
We will sing at the very first spring
That the promise will come when the promise is made
Promise is made, promise is made

Shake it up, take me up
Face to face 
Face to face
Face to face


YES LYRICS - If You Only Knew




I can lift you with my heart
Give you meaning every day 
Cannot live without your truth

And be the true me 
To be the true you

Pick the flowers from your floor
Put them in your arms for you my love
Realise my life and more

Say you will 'n' then

Take me home
Make me clear
It feels so much better
Take me home
To this heart of hearts

If only you knew
You caught me when I was falling
Yes you caught me when I was falling fast

And only you knew
You answered me when I was calling you
You saw me when I was dreaming you
Into my life 

Everyone who looks at you
Sees the loving in your every move
You're the healing of the soul

To be the true you
To be the true me

I will be your strength all time
Ever wishing you this love and more
Forever be your guiding song

Say you will and then

Take me home 
Make me clear
To feel so much better
In this life 
In your heart of hearts

If  only you knew
How you caught me when I was falling
Yes you caught me when I was falling fast

And only you knew
You answered me when I was calling you
You saw me when I was dreaming you
Into my life

When I feel the hurt in so many peoples' lives
I take a deep breath and think of your smile your eyes

When I hear the sadness of this earthtime
Then I take a deep breath and know that you understand
That you understand     

And only you knew
How you caught me when I was falling fast
Caught me when I was falling fast

If  only you knew
How you answered me when I was calling you
You saw me when I was dreaming you

If  only you knew
Yes you caught me when I was falling fast
You caught me when I was falling
Into your life


YES LYRICS - To Be Alive (Hep Yadda)




Not a lot is missing
Every ounce of treasure found 
And I believe that everyone should get what
They're allowed
Suspected of belief that comes suspended
In a sound 
And everybody wants some

It's the sound they make in heaven 
It's a sound for here on earth
I've heard it in the whispering
Of  the wonders that we search
We've waited far too long 
To hear the healing of the stars
'N' everybody wants some

Everybody wants some
Everybody wants some
Everybody wants some
Everybody wants some
To feel alive

Oh - does it get much better than this
Oh - does it get much better, much better
Oh - does it get much better than this, than this

There's the sound that keeps you trying
There's the sound that makes you smile
There's a sound in every corner 
Of the world that we survive

Your temple is the harmony
You feel the sacred ground 
Just wishing for the secret
To appear within the sound
Watching for the morning star 
The rhythm of the sun
I hear it in my waking dreams
The singing has begun

The passion that we walk upon
The passion that we bring
Is written for the mountains
They love to hear us sing

Everybody wants some
Everybody wants some 
Everybody wants some 
Everybody wants some 
To feel alive

Oh - doesn't get much better than this
Oh - doesn't get much better than this, than this

Who made me make believe
I'm alive I'm living
Never underestimate
The signals coming to you
Oh
The sounding of the earth 
It shakes you, yes it shakes you
Oh
The sounding of the earth
It shakes you, let it shake you

Hep yadda


YES LYRICS - Finally




Finally... We put it to the test
Dedicate to the true believer in you 
Finally... Put it to the test
Finally

Make no mistake to the mainstream
Music be the master planner
Just like the books you read
You'll hear it on your radio scanner

It's not so much what you know 
Or who you know that's coming
Its what you do regardless
Its what you do... eventually

Finally... We put it to the test
Dedicate to the true believer in you 
Finally... Put it to the test
Finally

I've seen them running, down and out
Never mind the good intentions 
A dreamer with a reason to live
Is as clear as his next invention

You take a second look to find
A second chance at giving
The voices say do not despair
There's a real good reason you're living

I could feel the earth moving
I could see sky falling
We can chase the storm
We can sing the rain
Walk the final distance
Live this life again

Finally... We put it to the test
Dedicate to the true believer in you
Finally... Put it to the test telling me to let go

I can feel the earth moving (I can sing the rain)
I can feel the rain coming (live this life again)
I can feel the storm 
I can sing the rain
I can free my heart
Live this life again 
You can choose to stand
You can choose to fall
You can see the rain
You can have it all

I can feel the rain coming
I can feel the earth moving
I can feel the love coming

I can feel the earth moving
I can feel the rain coming
I can feel the love coming
I can feel the earth moving


YES LYRICS - The Messenger




Judging by the voice
He was free to himself so real
We slaved ourselves to sacrifice
More than that we do not know
Then you hear him on the radio
He would play the sacred themes
That my children sang to me

Amazing as it seems 
It was the answer to my dream
His heart that touches me
More than that I do not not know
Then I hear him on the radio
Remembering his every word

That my children sing to me
We have seen the world, this ecstasy
Now my children sing to me
This loving place, beyond belief

You got to stand stand to to together
Keep the message alive 

You got to stand stand to to together
To keep the message alive

Spirit up moving, spirit up
Rhythm of sunfire

You got to stand stand to to together
Keep the message alive

Listening for his words
He would speak in ancient verse
So we mesmerize a way to go
Reaching out the universe
Reaching out the universal
Not afraid to learn new words

That our children sing to us
We have seen the world, this ecstasy
So his children bring to us
This inner peace, beyond belief

You got to stand stand to to together
Keep the message alive 

You got to stand stand to to together
To keep the message alive

Spirit up moving, spirit up
Rhythm of sunfire

You got to stand stand to to together 
Keep the message alive

One voice
One world
One touch
One life... truly, truly say it
One world... one voice
One touch... truly, truly say it
Some people realise
Some people see it 
From the beginning 
One world... one touch
One voice... one life
One touch... one voice... one world... one life


YES LYRICS - New Language




I speak from some sort of protection of learning
Even tho' I make it up as I go on
A special trait is that I've tried
To reach all feelings
So I speak a new language of love

Some say that it is written in the circle
Others that it is written in the sun
But I protect myself by seeing this experience
As a metaphor for moving on

Sometimes I check myself
To start to believe in
The horoscopes you read everyday
They're telling me somethings
I really ought to know
But then again I like to
Then again I learn to
Then again I'm running away

Vision is coming so fast I can't stop myself
Vision forgets who is real
On the city streets, people get lost
Just waiting for history
Pushing the real world away

Taking a chance only once in your life
Only weakness can stop you from hearing
New languages
Translate each word
As they bring you creation
Your voice is the perfect key

Is there something that
I'm supposed to see

Is there something that I'm
Supposed to feel
I'm with you
And I can't help but want to know

(Talk to me)
Is there something that I'm supposed to teach
(Speak to me)
Is there something that I'm supposed to find
As I reach to the healing in each spoken word

For some strange reason time just cannot wait a minute
I'm chasing every second before I let go
Yesterday my history
Dreams are still a mystery
This living is a gift I should know

Lay it down and let me live the new language
Let me learn at every twist every turn
Lay it down and let me love the further future
Let me know I'm running
Let me know I'm learning
Let me know I'm moving on

Vision is racing so fast I can't stop myself
Chasing the reason
For all kinds of wondering
People embracing these feelings of limbo
Just waiting for some kind of truth

Taking a chance as it comes only once
Only strength can do justice
With words of new languages
Translate creation
To bring you salvation
Your voice is the perfect key

(Talk to me)
Is there something that
I'm supposed to see
(Speak to me)
Is there something that I'm
Supposed to feel
I'm with you
And I can't help but want to know
(New languages)

(Talk to me)
Is there something that
I'm supposed to teach
(Speak to me)
Is there something that I'm supposed to find
As I reach to the healing of each spoken word (new languages)

Taking a chance as it comes only once
Only strength can do justice
With words of new languages
Translate creation
To bring you salvation
Your voice is the perfect key

(Talk to me)
Is there something that
I'm supposed to see
(Speak to me)
Is it something that I'm
Supposed to feel
I'm with you
And I can't help but want to know
(New languages)

(Talk to me)
Is there something that
I'm supposed to teach
(Speak to me)
Is there something that I'm supposed to find
As I reach to the healing of each spoken word (new languages)
Is it something that I'm supposed to find
As I reach to the healing of each spoken word (new languages)


YES LYRICS - Nine Voices (Longwalker)




On a beach
North Africa
Nine tribesmen stand alone
Waiting for a distant call
Waiting for the world to answer
Thru' the night of a thousand stars
Encircled by the light
They began to sing a new song
Of forces that surround us

Nine voices
This dialogue
Nine voices
Singing as one
Nine voices
This dialogue
Nine voices

When the sun came up they sang
As the perfect calendar says
Each had the power of people
Speaking new languages
They gave forgiveness meaning
New ways of letting go
Each child is born for greatness
With forces that surround them

This voice
This dialogue
This voice
Singing as one
Nine voices
This dialogue
Nine voices
Singing as one
His voices
This dialogue
This voices
Singing as one

Nine voices
Nine voices
Nine voices
Nine voices
