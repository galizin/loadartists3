YES LYRICS - Siberian Khatru




Sing, bird of prey
Beauty begins at the foot of you, do you believe the manner?
Gold stainless nail
Torn through the distance of man as they regard the summit

Even Siberia goes through the motions, hold out and hold up
Hold down the window (outbound, river)
Hold out the morning that comes into view (bluetail, tailfly)
River running right on over my head

How does she sing?
Who holds the ring and ring and you will find me coming?
Cold reigning king
Hold all the secrets from you as they produce the movement

Even Siberia goes through the motions, hold out and hold up
Hold down the window (outbound, river)
Hold out the morning that comes into view (bluetail, tailfly)
River running right over the outboard, river
Bluetail, tailfly
Luther in time
Dood'ndoodit, dah, d't-d't-dah

Hold down the window
Hold out the morning that comes into view
Warm side, the tower
Green leaves reveal the heart spoken Khatru

Gold stainless nail
Torn through the distance of man as they regard the summit
Cold reigning king
Shelter the women that sing as they produce the movement
River running right on over
Then over my head outboard, river

Bluetail, tailfly
Luther in time
Suntower asking
Cover, lover
June cast, moon fast
As one changes
Heart gold, leaver
Soul mark, mover
Christian, changer
Called out, saviour
Moon gate, climber
Turn round, glider


YES LYRICS - The Revealing Science Of God (Dance Of The Dawn)




Dawn of light lying between a silence and sold sources
Chased amid fusions of wonder
In moments hardly seen forgotten
Coloured in pastures of chance dancing leaves cast spells of challenge
Amused but real in thought, we fled from the sea whole

Dawn of thought transferred through moments of days undersearching earth
Revealing corridors of time provoking memories
Disjointed but with purpose
Craving penetrations offer links with the self instructors sharp and tender love
As we took to the air a picture of distance

Dawn of our power we amuse redescending as fast as misused expression
As only to teach love as to reveal passion chasing late into corners
And we danced from the ocean

Dawn of love sent within us colours of awakening among the many wont to follow
Only tunes of a different age
As the links span our endless caresses for the freedom of life everlasting

Talk to the sunlight caller
Soft summer mover distance mine

Called out a tune but I never saw the face
Heard but not replaced
I ventured to talk but I never lost my place

Cast out a spell rendered for the light of day
Lost in lights array
I ventured to see as the sound began to play

What happened to this song we once knew so well
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell
I must have waited all my life for this
Moment moment

The future poised with the splendour just begun
The light we were as one
And crowded through the curtains of liquid into sun

And for a moment when our world had filled the skies
Magic turned our eyes
To feast on the treasure set for our strange device

What happened to wonders we once knew so well
Did we forget what happened, surely we can tell
We must have waited all our lives for this
Moment moment moment

Starlight movement
Reasons
Release forward
Tallest rainbow
Sun shower seasons
Life flower reasons

They move fast, they tell me
But I just can't believe that I can feel it
There's someone to tell you
Amid the challenge we look around in unison with you

Getting over overhanging trees, let them rape the forest
Thoughts would send our fusion clearly to be home
Getting over wars we do not mean, or so it seems so clearly
Sheltered with our passion clearly to be home

They move fast, they tell me
But I just can't believe they really mean to
There's someone to tell you
And I just can't believe our song will leave you

Skyline teacher
Warland seeker
Send out poison
Cast iron leader

And through the rhythm of moving slowly
Sent through the rhythm work out the story
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past

Young Christians see it from the beginning
Old people feel it, that's what they're saying
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past

They move fast, they tell me
But I just can't believe they really mean to
There's someone to tell you
A course towards a universal season

Getting over overhanging trees, let them rape the forest
They might stand and leave them clearly to be home
Getting over wars they do not mean, we charm the movement suffers
Call out all our memories clearly to be home

We've moved fast, we need love
A part we offer is our only freedom

What happened to this song we once knew so well
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell
We must have waited all our lives for this
Moment moment

Past present movers moments we'll process the future,
But only through Him we know
Send flowered rainbows

A piece apart chased flowers of the dark and lights of songs
To follow and show all we feel for and know of
Cast round

You seekers of the truth aceepting that reason will relive
And breathe and hope and chase and love
For you and you and you


YES LYRICS - America




Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together
I've got some real estate in my bag
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner's pies
And we walked off, walked off, walked off,to look for America

Kathy, I said, as we boarded the greyhound in Pittsburgh
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
Took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
They've all gone to look for America
All gone to look for America

Laughing on the bus, playing games with faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said be careful, his bow tie is really a camera

"Kathy, I'm lost", I said, although I knew she was sleeping
I'm empty and aching and I don't know why I'm
Counting the cars on the New Jersey turnpike
And they've all gone to look for America
All gone to look for America
All gone to look for America


YES LYRICS - Onward




Contained in everything I do
There's a love I feel for you
Proclaimed in everything I write
You're the light, burning brightly

Onward through the night
Onward through the night
Onward through the night of my life

Displayed in all the things I see
There's a love you show to me
Portrayed in all the things you say
You're the day leading the way

Onward through the night
Onward through the night
Onward through the night of my life

Onward through the night
Onward through the night
Onward through the night of my life


YES LYRICS - Awaken




High vibration go on 
To the sun
Oh, let my heart dreaming
Past a mortal as me
Where can I be?

Wish the sun to stand still
Reaching out to touch our all being
Past all mortal as we
Here we can be
(He can be here)
(Be here now)
Here we can be

Suns | High | Streams | Through
Awaken gentle mass touch
(Gentle mass touch)
Awaken gentle mass touch
(Gentle mass touch)

Strong | Dreams | Reign | Here
Awaken gentle mass touch
(Gentle mass touch)
Awaken gentle mass touch
(Gentle mass touch)
Awaken gentle mass touch

(Star | Song)

Star | Song | Age | Less
Awaken gentle mass touching
(Gentle mass touch)
Awaken gentle mass touching
(Gentle mass touch)
Awaken gentle mass touching
Touching...
Touching...
Touching...

Workings of man
Set to ply out historical life
Reregaining the flower of the fruit of his tree
All awakening
All restoring you 

Workings of man
Crying out from the fire set aflame
By his blindness to see 
That the warmth of his being
Is promised for his seeing 
His reaching so clearly 

Workings of man
Driven far from the path
Rereleased in inhibitions
So that all is left for you
All is left for you
All is left for you
All is left for you NOW... 

Master of images
Songs cast a light on you
Hark thru dark ties
That tunnel us out of sane existence
In challenge as direct
As eyes see young stars assemble 

Master of light
All pure chance
As exists cross divided
In all encircling mode
Oh closely guided plan
Awaken in our heart 

Master of soul
Set to touch
All impenetrable youth
Ask away
That thought be contact
With all that's clear
Be honest with yourself
There's no doubt 
No doubt 

Master of time
Setting sail
Over all our lands
And as we look
Forever closer
Shall we now bid
Farewell farewell... 

High vibration go on
To the sun, oh let my heart dreaming
Past a mortal as me
Where can I be 

Wish the sun to stand still
Reaching out to touch our own being
Past all mortal as we
Here we can be

Like the time I ran away
Turned around and you were standing close to me
Like the time I ran away
Turned around and you were standing close to me


YES LYRICS - Roundabout




I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley

The music dance and sing
They make the children really ring
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you

I will remember you
Your silhouette will charge the view
Of distance atmosphere
Call it morning driving thru the sound and even in the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you

Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching down on the land
Catching the swirling wind the sailor sees the rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings create as weather spins out of hand

Go closer hold the land feel partly no more than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time a thousand answers by in our hand
Next to your deeper fears we stand surrounded by a million years

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
Twenty four before my love and I'll be there

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
You spend the day your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you


YES LYRICS - Starship Trooper




Sister bluebird flying high above
Shine your wings forward to the sun
Hide the myst'ries of life on your way
Though you've seen them, please don't say a word
What you don't know, I have never heard

Starship trooper, go sailing on by
Catch my soul, catch the very light
Hide the moment from my eager eye
Though you've seen them, please don't tell a soul
What you can't see, can't be very whole

Speak to me of summer
Long winters longer than time can remember
The setting up of other roads
To travel on in old accustomed ways
I still remember the talks by the water
The proud sons and daughter 
That knew the knowledge of the land
Spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways

Mother life, hold firmly on to me
Catch my knowledge higher than the day
Lose as much as only you can show
Though you've seen me, please don't say a word
What I don't know, I have never shared

Loneliness is a power that we possess to give or take away forever
All I know can be shown by your acceptance of the facts there shown before you
Take what I say in a different way and it's easy to say that this is all confusion
As I see a new day in me, I can also show it you and you may follow

Speak to me of summer
Long winters longer than time can remember
The setting up of other roads
To travel on in old accustomed ways
I still remember the talks by the water
The proud sons and daughter 
That knew the knowledge of the land
Spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways


YES LYRICS - Be The One




Never underestimate the loving
How we intertwine our very soul
How we fill each other's spaces to lose control
When you're talking, be the children
Who stand on solid ground
Never underestimate the giving that will bring you around

I'll be there, to bring you this love in the morning
I'll be there, to bring you the stars at night
I'll be there, just waiting to hear you singing

Never underestimate a giver
The gift of love will surely be
When you're asking for the secrets to set you free
When you're talking to the friendship
That love of higher self
This gift of love is the answer to all your doubts

Be the one, giving in to love
Never let the good in life desert you
Be the one, giving in to love
Never let the fools destroy your dreams
Be the one, giving in to love
I can dream myself every minute
So how did we become, masters of limitation?

I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there, to make it right for you

Giving in, giving in to love
It's the balance of this everyday feeling
Giving in, giving in to love
Without love our dreams become illusion
Giving in, giving in to right love
I can hear you singing every minute
So you can sing the song, and see the truth


YES LYRICS - That, That Is




[I. TOGETHERNESS (Instrumental)]

[II. CROSSFIRE]

Julie's sick and tired of her job n'all the reasons lately
She took it out on God and laid her soul to hell and let the baby die
Julie's child was born without a need or a reason for being
She took it as a message from a real and a distant life

Shirley gets to help her with the child though she's strung out on crack time
Shirley never knew what it was to be held in real love
Together getting high to get to mess up their night
Anything to get up so they're losing their mind
Just to get high, breaking out from this life, gotta get them a drug to get higher

Julie gets to walking out and drags the child, says 'come on'
How we'll walk in the dark of the morning
Car is screaming round the corner, drugged to heaven, guns are loaded, locked in vengeance

Who shoots the child?

Watching in the ghetto is the spine and the cruel of the gang life
Sign language of the get go you get in the gang life
Fear the only law, fear is all we hear about,
Feed us in tha raw, fear is all we fear about,
Listen, get up, quickly get up, get up
It's the answer to punishement given you

Don't give us reasons,
Caught in the crossfire dying
God give us reasons,
God get a reason, God give a reason
Why lay dead a child's life?

[III. THE GIVING THINGS]

That talk is just a worry and a worry in a man
That life is just a worrying and getting in a mess
That deal is just awakening his spirit to be giving him
The pleasure of the giving things within
This day is of a meeting of the manner to be borne
And like a ship you come safely to the shore of love eternal

[IV. THAT IS]

That talk is just a worry and a worry in a man
That life is just a worrying and getting in a mess
That deal is just awakening his spirit to be giving him
The pleasure of the giving things within

That word is in it, that talk is in it
This day is of a meeting of the manner to be borne
And like a ship you come safely to the shore of love eternal

That beat is of the wanting of the where you're going
That street talk is the basis of the push and shove
They never told you that you have the right
The spirit of the angel, angels sing "Shaava, shava shava-Shaava"

They be waiting for you, they be asking for you
We depending on you, we depending on your healing of the structure centre
Until you reach and touch your own redemption

They never give you a reason, they never give you a reason
They never give you a, give you a, give you a, give you a reason

[V. ALL IN ALL]

All in all the wisdom call, you shall be young, you shall be free
Watching for the signals that come easily
Take it as a point of love, a reference place to where you are
Every step a step to set you free

All for the sake and the calling of light
Ask as you give, as you measure in time

All in all this will to give, this sacrament, this need to live
Take it as a step to bring love easily
All in all the wisdom call, you shall be young, you shall be free
Waiting for the waiting to be free

Talk is the easy end, everyone heard
Ask as you seek the clear, ask and you can

This play is of a myriad of conscience sitting
This day is of a special way of love relating
This sight is in it, this way is in it, the dream is of the positive to
make you
Wonder
How did heaven begin?
This time is in it, this thought is in it, this light is in it,
When you see, you get it

All in all the wisdom call, you shall be young, you shall be free
Take it as it comes so easily

We'll be there beside the sign, the wherewithal, this will to be,
Bringing all the love that's meant to be
All in all we shall be young, we shall be free, we shall be there
All in all this time is meant to be

[VI. HOW DID HEAVEN BEGIN]

These days are just a worry to the children of the world
These days are just a worry to the children of the world
How did heaven begin?
How did heaven begin?

[VII. AGREE TO AGREE]

Don't imagine any way, so any fool can take away the drugs and the pressure
Asking for the level where a world divides its answers
To the gang lords of evil life, they can't show you how
Look upon this life as just a picture you are painting
There is a reason for this being
Look upon this place as just a part of all that is
It is a spiritual part of being

Live with the power, you can be the strength it is
Walk among the living, you can be the strength it is
To give, to live, this hope, comes through,
It takes the trust to agree this agreement
Live for the breaking free
Live for the breaknig freedom
Just let it come through come through
