YES LYRICS - Owner Of A Lonely Heart




Move yourself
You always live your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself
You are the move you make
Take your chances win or loser

See yourself
You are the steps you take
You and you - and that's the only way

Shake - shake yourself
You're every move you make
So the story goes

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than - a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Say - you don't want to chance it
You've been hurt so before

Watch it now
The eagle in the sky
How he dancin' one and only
You - lose yourself
No not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself
Give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than - a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart

After my own decision
They confused me so
My love said never question your will at all
In the end you've got to go
Look before you leap
And don't you hesitate at all - no no
Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than - a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
[repeat]

Owner of a lonely heart

Sooner or later each conclusion
Will decide the lonely heart
It will excite it will delight
It will give a better start

Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart

Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all
Just receive it

Owner of a lonely heart


YES LYRICS - Hold On




Justice to the left of you
Justice to the right
Speak when you are spoken to
Don't pretend you're right
This life's not for living
It's for fighting and for war
No matter what the truth is
Hold on to what is yours

Jigsaw puzzle traitors
Set to spill the beans
Constitution screw up
Shattering the dreams
Blood flows in the desert
Dark citadels burning too
Watch! Look over your shoulder
This one is strictly for you

Hold on - Hold on
Wait maybe the answer's
Looking for you

Hold on - Hold on
Wait! Take you time
Think it through
Yes! I can make it through

Hold on - Hold on
Sunshine shine on through
Hold on - Hold on
Sunshine shine on you

See it through

Talk the simple smile
Such platonic eye
How they drown in incomplete capacity
Strangest of them all
When the feeling calls
How we drown in stylistic audacity
Charge the common ground
Round and round and round
We living in gravity

Shake - We shake so hard
How we laugh so loud
When we reach
We believe in eternity

I believe in eternity

Hold on - Hold on
Wait - Take your time
See it through
Hold on - Hold on
Wait - Maybe a chance
Is looking for you

Sunshine shine on through

Sunshine shine on through
Sunshine shine on you

Hold on - Hold on
Hold on - Hold on

Sunshine - Shine on - Shine on you
Sunshine - Shine on through
Sunshine - Shine on - Shine on through
Sunshine - Shine on you

Sunshine - Shine on - Shine on you
Sunshine - Shine on through

Sunshine - Shine on - Shine on through
Sunshine - Shine on you
Hold on - Hold on
Wait - Take your time
See it through
Hold on - Hold on
Wait - Maybe the answer's looking for you


YES LYRICS - It Can Happen




You can fool yourself
You can cheat until you're blind
You can cut your heart
It can happen

You can mend the wires
You can feed the soul apart
You reach
It can happen to you
It can happen to me
It can happen to everyone eventually

It's a constant fight
A constant fight
You're pushing the needle to the red
Black and white
Who knows who's right
No substitute you're born you're dead
Fly by night
Created out of fantasy
Our destinations call

Look up - Look down
Look out - Look around
Look up - Look down
There's a crazy world outside
We're not about to lose our pride

It can happen to you
It can happen to me
It can happen to everyone eventually

As you happen to say
It can happen today
As it happens
It happens in every way

This world I like
We architects of life
A song a sigh
Developing words that linger
Through fields of green through open eyes
This for us to see

Look up - Look down
Look out - Look around
So look up - Look down
There's a crazy world outside
We're not about to lose our pride

It can happen to you
It can happen to me
It can happen to everyone eventually

As you happen to say
It can happen today
As it happens
It happens in every way

As you happen to see
It will happen to be
Nothing happens to nowhere and nowhere

[Solo]

Look up - Look down
There's a crazy world outside
We're not about to lose our pride

It can happen to you
It can happen to me
It can happen to everyone eventually

As you happen to see
It will happen to be
Nothing happens to nowhere and nowhere

You can fool yourself
You can cheat until you're blind
You can cut your heart

You can fool yourself
You can cheat until you're blind
It can happen to you
It can happen to me

You can cut your heart

It can happen to everyone eventually
As you happen to say
It can happen today
As it happens
It happens in every way

You can mend the wires
You can feed the soul apart
You can touch your life
You can bring your soul alive
It can happen to you
It can happen to me
It can happen to everyone eventually

As you happen to say
It can happen today
As it happens
It happens in every way


YES LYRICS - Changes




I'm moving through some changes
I'll never be the same
Something you did touched me
There's no one else to blame

The love we had has fallen
The love we used to share
We've given up pretending
As if you didn't care

Change changing places
Root yourself to the ground
Capitalize on this good fortune
One word can bring you round
Changes

I look into the mirror
I see no happiness
All the warmth I gave you
Has turned to emptiness
The love we had has fallen
The love we used to share
You've left me here believing
In love that wasn't there

Change changing places
Root yourself to the ground
Word to the wise - Well you get what's coming
One word can bring you round
Changes

When I look into your eyes and try to find out how
There's no way to save it now
And everything I feel
Changes
Keep looking for
Changes
Changes

For some reason you're questioning why
I always believe it gets better
One difference between you and I
Your heart is inside your head

One word from you
One word from me
A clear design on your liberty
Who could believe when love has gone
How we move on like everyone

Only such fools
Only such jealous hearts

Only through love changes come

Change changing places
Root yourself to the ground
Capitalize on this good fortune
One word can bring you round
Changes

One road to loneliness
It's always the same
One road to happiness
It's calling your name

Change changing places - Changes
Root yourself to the ground
Capitalize on this good fortune
One word can bring you round
Changes

Change changing places
Changes
Root yourself to the ground
Word to the wise - Well you get what's coming
One word - One word can bring you round
Changes


YES LYRICS - Leave It




I can feel no sense of measure
No illusions as we take
Refuge in young man's pleasure
Breaking down the dreams we make
Real

One down one to go
Another town and one more show
Downtown they're giving away
But she never came back

No phone can take your place
You know what I mean
We have the same intrigue
As a court of kings

Ah leave it
Ah leave it
Two down there you go
McArthur Park in the driving snow
Uptown they're digging it out
Better lay your claim

Get home you're not alone
You just broke out of the danger zone
Be there to show your face
On another dreamy day

Ah leave it
Ah leave it

Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
Hello hello heaven

Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
Hello hello heaven
Ah leave it

Ah leave it

I can feel no sense of measure
No illusions as we take
Refuge in young man's pleasure
Breaking down the dreams we make
Real

Ah leave it
Ah leave it

Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
Hello hello heaven

Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
Hello hello heaven

One down one to go
Another town and one more show

One down one to go
Another town and one more show
Ah leave it

Ah leave it

Ah leave it
Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
Hello hello heaven

Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad

Leave it


YES LYRICS - Our Song




Toledo was just another good stop
Along the good king's highway
My fortification took me by surprise
And hit me sending me sideways
Spellbound - Roundly - Good for sunshine
Can't help thinking

Singing the Rule Britannia
And this is where it grabs you
There's method in the key of C
Toledo's got to be the silver city
In this good country

Our song
It gives us a reason
Our song
That good remedy
Music has magic
That stuff of syncopation

Ever tried driving it to golden heights
Just simply jiving it
My mystification it got a
Jewel skies crazy spacing it
Hot sun - Crowded - Screams high voices
Singing speechless

Touching of the healing heart
So this is where we really start
Music is a shout of foregone conclusions
As long as music plays its part
Good good part

Our song
It gives us a reason
Our song
That good remedy
Music has magic
It's good clear syncopation

Treat it good
Treat it rightly
And if you get it flowing
The harmony is glowing
So get ready
So get ready
Don't go toledo toledo don't go
Music - Good to you
Music - Good to you


YES LYRICS - City Of Love




City of love City of love City of love

Once bitten twice shy
No - No regrets at all
Justice - Body smooth take over
Good girls they work the city
Good guys they spike you hard
How they jive ad jingle
When you're in their backyard

Street corner wonder lust
Beckoning the good guy
Take this get that
Have a good time

He young and tactile
He ready for anything that is
How they jive and jingle
They've read the book that gives

We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come

We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come

Supervise this good treatment
Alternative line by line
So the street guys so observant
Take him for a ride
Have a good time
Like a legend the man he sharp
His woman gladly watching
As he strides out of the dark
Better be quick get away

We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come

We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come

[Solo]

Good timing has its good price
One trick and you're stuck with the dice
How they jive and jingle
When you're their sacrifice

Fast as lightning
Go - Go get high - He's looking good
Once bitten twice shy
No woman no cry
No woman don't cry

We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come

[repeat three times]


YES LYRICS - Hearts




Hearing - Talking - Yes I - Love you

Set your heart sail on the river
Look around you as you drift downstream
Pouring souls into the ocean
Take account of all you've seen

Hearing
Talking
Love you

One people - Together
Freedom for today
So easy the future
So see the children's way

Love me
Teach me
Know me

One people - Together
Freedom for today
Tomorrow forever
So see the people's way

Many moons cascade one river
They light from side to side
As we cross in close proximity
Like rivers our hearts entwine
How we talk - How we teach our children
How we move - We direct our eyes
All the senses tuned discovery
As and as and when our hearts decide
Be ready now - Be ye circle
Be the central force ye life
As the game extends the cycle
Be ready to move

One heart's for love
One's for giving
Two hearts are better
Than one
I hearing it
I living it
I believe in it
Two hearts are better
Than one
Hearts
Sailing down the river
Hearts
Throwing out a line
Hearts

Sharing out your fortunes
Hearts
In and out of time

Hearing - Talking - Yes I - Love

[Solo]

One heart's for love
One's for giving
Two hearts are better
Than one
I hearing it
I living it
I believe in it
I loving it
Two hearts are better
Than one
Hearts
Sailing down the river
Hearts
Throwing out a line
Hearts

Sharing out your fortunes

Hearts
In and out of time

Who would believe you - Wise men do
Days that we knew it clear with you
You sing the answers question time
Now it you need me let our hearts entwine
Let our hearts entwine

Hearts - Sailing down the river
Hearts - Throwing out a line
I hearing it - I living it - I believe in it - I loving it

Hearts
Two hearts will always be
In and out of time

[Solo]

One heart's for love

As we flow down life's rivers
I see the stars glow - One by one
All angels of the magic constellation
Be singing us now
