YES LYRICS - Roundabout




I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley

The music dance and sing
They make the children really ring
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you

I will remember you
Your silhouette will charge the view
Of distance atmosphere
Call it morning driving thru the sound and even in the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you

Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching down on the land
Catching the swirling wind the sailor sees the rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings create as weather spins out of hand

Go closer hold the land feel partly no more than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time a thousand answers by in our hand
Next to your deeper fears we stand surrounded by a million years

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
Twenty four before my love and I'll be there

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
You spend the day your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you


YES LYRICS - We Have Heaven




Tell the Moon-dog, tell the March-hare
Tell the Moon-dog, tell the March-hare
We...have...heaven
To Look around, to look around
Yes, he is here; Yes, he is here


YES LYRICS - South Side Of The Sky




A river a mountain to be crossed
the sunshine in mountains sometimes lost
around the south side so cold that we cried
were we ever colder on that day a million miles away
it seemed from all of eternity

Move forward was my friends only cry
in deeper to somewhere we could lie
and rest for the day with cold in the way
were we ever colder on that day a million miles away
it seemed from all of eternity

The moments seemed lost in all the noise
a snow storm a stimulating voice
of warmth of the sky of warmth when you die
were we ever warmer on that day a million miles away
we seemed for all of eternity

The sunshine in mountains sometimes lost
the river can disregard the cost
and melt in the sky warmth when you die
were we ever warmer on that day a million miles away
we seemed from all of eternity


YES LYRICS - Long Distance Runaround




Long distance run around
long time waiting to feel the sound
I still remember the dream there
I still remember the time you said goodbye
did we really tell lies
letting in the sunshine
did we really count to one hundred

Cold summer listening
hot colour melting the anger to stone
I still remember the time you said goodbye
did we really tell lies
did we really count to one hundred

YES LYRICS - Heart Of The Sunrise




Love comes to you and you follow
Lose one on to the Heart of the Sunrise
SHARP-DISTANCE
How can the wind with its arms all around me

Lost on a wave and then after
Dream on on to the Heart of the Sunrise
SHARP-DISANCE
How can the wind with so many around me
lost in the city

Lost in their eyes as you hurry by
Counting the broken ties they decide
Love comes to you and then after
Dream on on to the Heart of the Sunrise
SHARP-DISTANCE
How can the wind with its arms all around me
SHARP-DISTANCE
How can the wind with so many around me
I feel lost in the city

Lost in their eyes as you hurry by
Counting the broken ties they decided

Straight light moving and removing
SHARPNESS of the colour sun shine
Straight light searching all the meanings of the song
Long last treatment of the telling that
relates to all the words sung
Dreamer easy in the chair that really fits you

Love comes to you and then after
Dream on on to the Heart of the Sunrise
SHARP-DISTANCE
How can the sun with its arms all around me
SHARP-DISTANCE
How can the wind with so many around me
I feel lost in the city
