YES LYRICS - Magnification




Days that we speak
I believe that you are right
Shouldn't chase the demons and the phantoms of the night

Some treat as lovers
Some treat as slaves
This fusion of insight is all that we imagine

Speak to me clearly
You're the magnet to my soul
I get so distracted to reason with it all
Like the faithful
I'm clinging to the edge of every world
Spinning in creation
So afraid to let my feelings really show

Teach me to teach me
How the keys unlock the door
As we open it we surrender, holding hands with many more

There's a feeling that's coming
There's a feeling so real
To justify, to magnify, to realize that everything is love

Now, after all the love you have
You can always get it back
Knowing how you really see
Knowing it will come to you
Knowing that it can really be

Magnificate, magnification
Magnificate, magnification
First you're smaller being alive
Growing taller learn to survive
Magnificate, magnification
Magnificate, magnification
First you're smaller being alive
Growing taller learn to survive

Perception of living
I realize I'm not alone
The rings that divide us
Break again upon the stone
I will show you a necklace
Where the pearls would all be lost
Without the thread between together
This would be the golden thread of trust

Speak to me, teach me
Magnify the truth you are
Waiting for the rebeginning birth of every star

A symbol is planted
On the brow of every child
To justify, to magnify
To realize that everything is love

Now giving all the love you have now
You will always get it back now
Giving all the love you have now
You will always get it back
Giving all the love you have
Giving all the love

Magnificate, magnification
Magnificate, magnification
First you're smaller being alive
Growing taller learn to survive


YES LYRICS - Spirit Of Survival




In this world the gods have lost their way

Can't keep this picture from out of my mind
This fear hand in hand crossing innoncence, time
Surrounding creation they caught in a trap
The youngest offenders will witness confusion

They drive him so fast not a care in the end
Escaping collision every twist every bend
When you're young invincible nothing to lose
Keep seeing this picture standing in a circle
The gods have forgotten to switch on the light
Who's lost in the dark will crash in the night

These lessons we're living the lies of the day
Expect them to honor and never disobey
Yet greed is controlling the elders display
No wonder the younger look at them in shame

The spirit of survival
Who's teaching the hatred
The spirit of survival
Or the class of your school
The spirit of survival
The colour of your money
We're standing in a circle
We don't understand at all

They don't understand at all

In this world I truly do believe there is a safer place
In this world I truly do believe there is a safer place

The younger the older the wiser become
Recover misfortune this true life as one
Our genius is shining the past has all gone
What's left is the clearest perception of one

The spirit of survival
To magnify the power
The spirit of survival
To magnify the soul
The spirit of survival
To magnify the love
We're standing in a circle
We  don't understand at all
We don't understand at all

In this world the gods have lost their way


YES LYRICS - Don't Go




Don't be so cruel hurting yourself 
Don't be so greedy making it bad 
Don't be so dark echoing out 
Don't spend the day waiting for me 

After all you didn't have to do it 
You broke your own heart; it hurt you so bad 
Why don't you take your defense down a little 
Or you won't understand at all 

Don't go, don't go let it 
Don't go, don't go let it 
Don't take love for granted 

We were supposed to be together forever 
Don't take love 
We were supposed to be together forever, yeah yeah 
Don't take love 

Don't be so sad scream at the moon 
Don't let your words come out too soon 
You beat yourself up 
So don't spend a day, hey, waiting for me 
I can see you had to be your own father 
I know he walked out on you 
Hey, but that's in the past 
You see you don't have a leg to stand on 
You're just fooling yourself again 

Don't go take it out 
Don't go let it 
Don't go take it out 
Don't go let it 
Don't take love 
We were supposed to be friends forever, yeah yeah 
Don't go take it out 
Don't go let it in 
We were supposed to be friends forever, yeah yeah 
Don't go take it out 
We were supposed to be friends foreverâ€¦ 

So he booked himself a trip, extended holiday 
None of this always working late 
The porter took him to his room; he headed for the bar 
To get another drink 
She got a phone call saying her love had ran away 
Just another phone call, another bad day 
She packed her keys got out of town 
Stole her best friend's car 
Promised she would bring it back 
That's what friends are for 

Hey do me a favor call me sometime 
Do a good deed 
Don't waste a minute waiting for me 
Don't take love, take take take it in 
For granted, take take take it out 
Don't go, don't go let it in 
We were supposed to be together forever, forever. 
Don't take love, take take take it in 
For granted, take take take it out 
Don't take love, take take take it in 
For granted, take take take it out 
We were supposed to be together forever, yeah yeah 
Don't take love for granted 
Don't take love for granted 
We were supposed to be together forever, yeah yeah 
Don't go take it out 
Don't go let it in


YES LYRICS - Give Love Each Day




Standing here on sacred ground
Some days it's a mad world let it be
Words of promise fill the air, empty voices
How long have we waited?

And every time I hold your hand
You bring to me this promised land
I live for you, this promised land

Take me there and back again
Some days it's a sad world let it be
What's the point of looking for this power divine?
It's already in my changes

And every time I hear your voice
I realize I have the choice
To live again, I deserve this choice
To live again

Our heaven will be now
You are the song from the book of time
To realize what is yours is mine
We are meant to be
All because our love has always been
You are the centre of my day
You are my guide in every way
We were meant to be
All because our love has always been there
Giving me the light
Yes it's been there
Giving me the light

Second nature sings to me
Some days it's a dark world let it be
I define my right to be
I can follow those who've lost their vision

And every time I hold your hand
You redesign my promised land
I live for you, this promised land
I live for you

You are the song from the book of time
To realise what is yours is mine
We are meant to be
All because our love has always been
You are the centre of my day
You are my guide in every way
We were meant to be
All because our love has always been there
Giving me the light (Giving me the light)
Yes it's been there, giving me the light

You are the song from the book of time
To realise what is yours is mine
We are meant to be
All because our love has always been
You are the centre of my day
You are my guide in every way
We were meant to be
All because our love has always been there
Giving me the light
Yes it's been there giving me the light

Give love each day
Give love each day
Give love each day
Give love each day
Give love each day
Give love each day
Give love each day
Give love each day
Give love each day
Give love each day
Give love each day


YES LYRICS - Can You Imagine




Can you imagine what it's like seeing life 
From the other side 
Do you imagine darkened light, starless night? 
You might need a guide 

And will the illusion confuse you, play with your thoughts 
And alter your mind 
Or become a delusion, include you 
Change your existence 
For another kind 

See what you see for yourself, 'til your heart 
Is open wide 
Wish what you wish for yourself, and you find it there 
And you believe it 
And you believe it 

Can you imagine what it's like, seeing life 
From the other side 
Do you imagine light darkened, starless night 
You might need a guide

And will the illusion confuse you, play with your thoughts 
And alter your mind 
Or become a delusion, excuse you 
Change your existence 
For another kind 

See what you see for yourself, 'til your heart 
Is open wide 
Wish what you wish for yourself, and you find it here 
And you believe it 
And you believe it


YES LYRICS - We Agree




Answers never clear again 
This turning of the page 
This turn look away 

There I took a left turning 
Before I came of age 
I agreed to let it out 
I agreed to let it go 
I agreed to turn around 
I agreed to turn my face away 

Danger is the most important 
Fear you'll ever know 
The transporting of refugees 
The silent night is cold 

And all the time 
We looked around 
As we were never told 

But we agreed to let it out 
We agreed to let it go 
We agreed to turn our backs 
We agreed to turn our face away, away 

Thousands to the million 
Sisters, grandmothers and more 
It's not the feast we throw away 
It's the way we close the door 

Their silence deafens every sound 
We try just to ignore 
To waste their future freedom 
We'll regret forever more 

I believe in 
I believe in 
These are the days that we will talk about 
I believe in 
I believe in 
One understanding what is real 

If we are one 
Then we are refugees 
We are the prisoners of our own design 
If we are one 
Seen through the eyes of a child 
We will perpetuate this song of love 
If we are one 
Seen through the eyes of a child 
We will perpetuate this song of love 
If we are one 
Seen through the eyes of a child 
We will perpetuate this song 
Perpetuate this song of love 

Now we build the bridges 
That we walk upon together 
At the last count many lonely souls 
The sadness always kills 

Each breaking point is waiting 
For the promise to fulfill 

When we agree to turn the page 
When we agree to help them free 
When we agree to let it out 
When we agree to let it shine 
When we agree to let it run 
When we agree to let it change our lives 

I believe in, our lives 
I believe in, our lives 
These are the days we will talk about 

When we are one 
Seen through the eyes of child 
We will perpetuate this song of love 

When we are one 
Seen through the eyes of child 
We will perpetuate this song of love 
Song of love 

Yeah, yeah, perpetuate this song of love 

Seeing through the eyes of child 
Seeing through the eyes of child


YES LYRICS - Soft As A Dove




Soft as a dove 
Touching the hand that lays next to me 
Innocent light 
Leading us through a moment in time 

Then you came home 
I let you cry like a father should do 
Innocent light 
Leading us to a moment in time 

Soft as a dove 
Touching the hand that lays next to me 
Innocent light 
Leading us through this moment in time 
Thoughts run away 
You're overcome by a flood of believing 

Just like a dove you're flying away 
Everything beautiful coming your way 
Everything beautiful coming your way


YES LYRICS - Dreamtime




Dreamtime begins 
Where every song is the perfect place 
Words never spoken 
Are the strongest resounding 

Life force is meant for us 
To remember the stars, the earth 
Still we forget 
So asleep in this dreamtime 
Lost in this dreamtime day 

Take me up into that freedom place and justify 
Electrify the senses sharpen than the soul intensify 
Nominate that we can break out take, take, take, take together 
Hesitate and you will dance on this earth to, to forever 

You are the choice forever trying 
Give you wings forever flying 
You can fly, you can glide, you can dream 
You can see through this interactive vision streaming 

You have the faith 
So busy trying 
So let it go 
Forever flying 

To the sky, to the earth, to the moon, to the sea 
To the sun, to the stars, to the dream you become 

Nothing left to lose 
Nothing more to prove 
With wings of gold 
You'll fly away 

Talk among the prophets 
Give you something 
Talk among the teachers 
Tell you something 
Talk among your one true self now 
Forever, forever, forever, forever 

Dreamtime begins 
Where every song is the perfect place 
Words never spoken 
Are the strongest resounding 

Life force is meant for us 
To remember the stars, the earth 
Still we forget 
So asleep in this dreamtime 
Lost in this dreamtime day 

Take me up into that freedom place and justify 
On the silent wings of gold my soul intensify 
Nominate that we can take, take, take, take, take, together 
Demonstrate that we can break it out and take it forever 

Here's what you know 
Here's what you're asking 
The soul is everlasting


YES LYRICS - In The Presence Of




Deeper than every ocean 
Deeper than every river 
That's what your presence brings to me 

Revealing the words I listen 
Seeing you in my silence 
Learning I'm with you constantly 
As I was before 

If we were flowers 
We would worship the sun 
So why not now? 
This high is shining brightly 
Brighter than before 

As the door was open wide 
There inside was a diamond chair 
Where I sat when I was young 
I wrote down the words 

Only when the young at heart 
Can enter the real world 
This chance I've waited for 
For you to see 

If I had chances I would spend them with you 
To hold you close and let your love surround me 
Deeper than before 

(Deeper than every ocean) 
And I know this love is real 
(Deeper than every river) 
Realize this is meant to be 
That's what your eyes they say to me 
You are listening to how I feel 
So expectedly 
(Brighter than every morning) 
From the ocean to the sky 
(Beautiful as the sunset) 
Every river to the sea 
Nature surrounds me constantly 
We can hear love constantly 
This is for you and me 

Turn around and come deeper now 
So what happens when I touch you there 
You feel the words roll over you 
Thinking of the better scenes 
The memories 
As everybody else just 
Hasn't got the time 
To help you anymore 

'Cause if the reason for 
The things that pleasure us 
To please ourselves 
Not pressure us 
To give our ego 
Some pleasure time 

Can you imagine 
Any reason 
To know you're only fooling yourself 
And then you'll understand why 
You'll understand why 

So if we choose to realize 
All existence is a dream 
This perfect resume to you 
From me 

Just had a tough time with magic 
The death of ego 
The moon 
It was just coming through 

Send me such a good time 
In a letter form, tell me 
The pleasure, no pressure 
Pure imagination in a metaphoric dream 

I get amazed like a true beginner 
I get amazed like a true believer 
I get amazed when I see you there 
And I come alive 

I believe I'm a true beginner 
I believe I'm a true beginner 
In your arms I can see it all 
I can see it all 

If we were flowers 
We would worship the sun 
So why not now? 
This light is burning brightly 
This light is burning brightly 
Brighter than before 
Brighter than before 
Brighter than before 
Brighter than before 

Turn around and remember that 
When it gets so low 
As you finally hit the ground 

Turn around and remember that 
Now I'm standing tall 
Standing on my sacred ground 

Turn around and remember that 
When it gets so low 
As you finally hit the ground 

Turn around and remember that 
Now you're standing tall 
Standing on sacred ground 
Standing on sacred ground 
Standing on sacred ground


YES LYRICS - Time Is Time




Time has saved as time has moved 
Night has come at last to shine on you 

Last night I looked inside the moon 
And I knew you were real 

So every time I look at you 
You know exactly how I feel 

Time has saved us time has moved 
Night has come at last to shine on you 

Take the time to know how you will fill my life 
Revolving in my heart 

Time has saved us, time has moved us 
Night has come at last to shine on you again
