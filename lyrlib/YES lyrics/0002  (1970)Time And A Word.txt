YES LYRICS - No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed




Step out in the night 
When you're lonely 
Listening for the sounds 
That your ears don't hear

I know your cross is heavier 
With every step, every step 
But I know a man 
And he'd walk miles for you

Stop, you stay where you are 
Take a look at yourself 
Take a good look at yourself

Can tell your momma 
She'd only tell ya 
That she told you so

The life you're leading 
She won't believe 
The riches of life 
We all know

Dawn turns to day
And the dawning 
Daytime, nighttime 
And we still can't see

Why must we wait 
Until the morning light 
To wake up and be 
Wake up and be

Wake up and be 
Wake up and be 
Wake up and be

Step out in the night 
When you're lonely 
Listen for the sounds 
That your ears don't hear

I know your cross is heavier 
With every step, every step 
But I know a man 
Who'd walk miles for you

Stop, you stay where you are 
Take a look at yourself 
Take a good look at yourself

Can tell your momma 
She'd only tell ya 
That she told you so
The life you're leading 

She won't believe 
The riches of life 
We all know

Can tell your momma 
She'd only tell ya 
That she told you so

The life you're leading 
She won't believe 
The riches of life 
We all know


YES LYRICS - Then




And in a time that's closer, life will be even bolder then.
Souls will be complicated, life will be consummated then.
Hearts will be brought together soon in our minds forever then.
As long as we see there's only us, who can change it;
Only us to rearrange it at the start of a new kind of day.
And in a time that's closer, life will be even bolder then.
Love is the only answer, hate is the root of cancer then.
Thoughts will be thought together, soon in our minds forever then.

Love is the only answer, hate is the root of cancer then.
Truth is just for the being and there's the sight for seeing then.
Thoughts will be brought together soon in our minds forever then.
As long as we see there's only us, who can change it;
Only us to rearrange it at the start of a new kind of day.
And in a time that's closer, life will be even bolder then.
Love is the only answer, hate is the root of cancer then.
Thoughts will be thought together, soon in our minds forever then.


YES LYRICS - Everydays




Look at the sad goodbyes
Everyday's a killing time
Sun coming up outside
No men are born this time
Saturday's child stays home
Nothing to say so long

Well, well, well
Another day
Well, well, well
Another day

Grocery store, ten bucks
Just making change for plastic cherries
Up in a tree, jaybird
Laughing at me, no word
Everyone looks, you can't see
We can't be ignored easily

Well, well, well
Another day
Well, well, well
Another day

Soft within the wayward things
Like ecstasy
The sound of trees
Most anything
What a baby sees

Beautiful face, alright
Many a place, out of sight
Old woman there with red shoes
One million balloons, all used
Drive over hills, forget your fear
Getting it out of second gear

Well, well, well
Another day
Well, well, well
Another day

Well, well, well
Another day
Well, well, well
Another day


YES LYRICS - Sweet Dreams




Sweet dreams can solve the future,
Sweet dreams provide the past.
Sweet things within your makeup;
These things will always last,
These things will make

Sweet dreams of conversation,
Sweet dreams of love affection.
Sweet words within your makeup;
Sweet words of things to

Come on and write your letter,
You know it will be better anyhow.
You're gonna laugh again,
You're gonna smile again,
You're gonna love again.

Sweet dreams are born inside you,
Sweet dreams are born to last.
Sweet thoughts within your makeup;
These thoughts will always last,
These thoughts will always last.

Come on and write your letter,
You know it will be better anyhow.
You're gonna laugh again,
You're gonna smile again,
You're gonna love again.

Sweet dreams can solve the future,
Sweet dreams provide the past.
Sweet dreams can solve the future,
Sweet dreams provide the past.


YES LYRICS - The Prophet




Long ago a tall man told a tale of yesterday,
Searching for the truth to life and not for just a way.
Finding pleasure from this house his ears, they did obey;
In his life a moment's pleasure, never to delay.
He was lost and in his trust he found a new meaning;
Seeing the things in diff'rent lights his life was redeemed.

Words of peace will fill his mind and change his way of life;
Peaceful meetings with his heart have made him more alive.
Meeting wise old women on the cliffs of life itself;
Asking not for pers'nal meaning, more for just himself.
Soon we'll be as he proclaimed in a new way of living;
Take the things you need in life but remember the giving.

Prophesy within your mind and you will work it out;
Prophesy that some will die but only those who doubt.
Then you'll never worry as somtimes you used to do;
Just remember when you're gone there's someone after you, you.


YES LYRICS - Clear Days




I once knew a sweet young girl;
Her body was her world of love,
Her laughter was as happiness is.
Of all the times I treasure this.
And on a day we will remember,
On a clear day we will love forever.

I once knew a sweet young dream,
That if life itself were all we had
And who are we to ask for more;
Let's not decide, let's be sure.
And on a day we will remember,
On a clear day we'll all be together,
Together.


YES LYRICS - Astral Traveller




And in the ruins
Caught in the noose around me,
Glasses tell lies.
Wondering when
To do it again of another
Flying to the sky,
Somewhere flying high.
Astral trav'ller,
Leaving without her,
Wond'ring where lives go;
In and out the valley below.

Once in the air,
We could expect a great respect in being.
(Astral trav'ller.)
Memories fly
Over the sky, and oh, the
Sight's worth seeing,
Just believin'.
Astral trav'ller,
Leaving without her,
Wond'ring where lives go;
In and out the valley below.


YES LYRICS - Time And A Word




In the morning when you rise,
Do you open up your eyes, see what I see?
Do you see the same things ev'ry day?
Do you think of a way to start the day
Getting things in proportion?
Spread the news and help the world go 'round.
Have you heard of a time that will help us get it together again?
Have you heard of the word that will stop us going wrong?
Well, the time is near and the word you'll hear
When you get things in perspective.
Spread the news and help the word go round.

There's a time and the time is now and it's right for me,
It's right for me, and the time is now.
There's a word and the word is love and it's right for me,
It's right for me, and the word is love.

Have you heard of a time that will help get it together again?
Have you heard of the word that will stop us going wrong?
Well, the time is near and the word you'll hear
When you get things in perspective.
Spread the news and help the word go round.

There's a time and the time is now and it's right for me,
It's right for me, and the time is now.
There's a word and the word is love and it's right for me,
It's right for me, and the word is love.
There's a time and the time is now and it's right for me,
It's right for me, and the time is now.
There's a word and the word is love and it's right for me,
It's right for me, and the word is love.
