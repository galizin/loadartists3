YES LYRICS - The Calling




Feel the calling of a miracle
In the presence of the word.
Now we hold the right to rearrange
How the stories can be heard.

In the beginning is the future,
And the future is at hand;
I'll be calling voices of Africa
Be the rhythm to the plan.

From the Congo to Lenasia
Be the writing on the wall.
I'll be calling the colors of India
See the Asian life explode.

Head in to the headlight.
Don't turn from the rain.
There's a fire raging somewhere near,
Like a longtime friend who's
Seen it darker than ebony.
Take off on the turnpike
(Asking for the first call)
Give me more of the same
(Asking for a song)
There's a fire burning in my heart again.

I'll be calling the dragons of China;
See the dancers of the Nile.
See the wings of change are on display
This revelation mine.

Feel the calling of a miracle
In the presence of the word.
Head in to the headlight.
Don't turn from the rain.
There's a fire raging somewhere near,
Like a longtime friend who's
Seen it darker than ebony.
Take off on the turnpike
(Asking for the first call)
Give me more of the same
(Asking for a song)
There's a fire burning in my heart again.

Feel the calling of a miracle,
The revelation mine.


YES LYRICS - I Am Waiting




Am I waking to this magic
Am I seeing, all is human,
Human after all...

I wanna be inside your heart
Are you ready
I wanna love forever
Are you thinking
I wanna be inside your heart
What I'm thinking
I wanna know you're with me.

Highways, starways, many ways
To be open tonight.
High time, look inside your life.
I am waiting.

I am waiting; are you ready?
I am waiting; can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

I happened in the water.
The heaven will fall.
The break in the water.
The secret birth.

Said she loves me; I believe her.
Waited lifetimes, say this to you.

I wanna be inside your heart
Are you ready
I wanna love forever
Are you thinking
I wanna be inside your heart
What I'm thinking
I wanna know you're with me.

Highways, starways, many ways
To be open tonight.
High time, look inside your life.
I am waiting.
Say you need me, I'm yours.
Say you need me, just because.

(It's our freedom...)
It's our freedom, hear me now.
We are made to be here now.
We'll be waiting for the word
As the healing of the world.
Make me promises, to be true,
All my life my world is you.

I am waiting; are you ready?
Are you ready?
I am waiting; can you hear me?
Can you hear me?


YES LYRICS - Real Love




Get the fire, as the flame it burns,
Get the wind as it slowly turns.
Get the earth as it circles by,
Get the sky see creation fly.

This point of living;
This point of giving;
This chance of living,
Has got to be known.

Get the fire, as the flame it burns,
Get the wind as it slowly turns.
Get the earth...
Get the sky...

Far away, in the depths of Hawking's mind
To the animal, primalistic grind,
You bring me reason, a simple fact of life.
(Bring me reason...)
You don't say you're sorry...

Call this real love
Activiates this mission
To be on the same timeline.
Call this free love
Get a ticket on the master plan.
On the freedom climb.

Get the fire, as the flame it burns,
Get the wind as it slowly turns.
Get the earth...
Get the sky...

This point of living;
This point of giving;
This chance of living
Far away, in the depths of Hawking's mind
To the animal, the primalistic grind,
You bring me reason, a simple fact of life.
You don't say you're sorry...
Call this free love
Activiates this mission
To be on the same timeline.
Call this free love
Get a ticket on the master plan.
On the freedom climb.

Call this free love
You can activate this message
On the concourse of your fine mind.
Call this real love
Get off those chains,
Get off those chains.
Get off those changes coming to you.


YES LYRICS - State Of Play




You can hear the siren screaming,
Take me to the promised land;
See the intervention
Take you higher and higher.
See we are the giving world,
We are responsible,
We're not about to break-

It's just a state of play
It's just a state of play

This is the revolution,
Coming with the giving world
No need to wait for your
Appointment is made.
No need to ask for help,
It's in the love we breathe
Dancing in the new design

It's just a state of play
It's just a state of play

Secret needing,
From this love I'm feeding
High time flying,
From your love I'm feeding
High time flying,
Monumental reaching to god love
Secret needing,
All I really want to know right now...
The state of play
Are you looking at it
Is it looking at you.

It's just a state of play
It's just a state of play

No point in kidding,
Let the children split the atom-
A firm believer this
Appointment with love.
All those who look for glory,
They see the flags are flying,
They hear the sirn screaming-
It's just a state of play
It's just a state of play
Secret needing,
From this love I'm feeding
High time, flying,
All I really want to know,
Right now, right now...
(I want to be inside your heart)
I want to know right now,
Is this the state of play.
Are you looking at it.


YES LYRICS - Walls




Don't you know it's my way out
To be on my own.
When I feel like crying out
I do it best alone.
Can you give me love and
Protection to shield my heart.
All the fear I feel from doubt
Is tearing me apart.

I wanna love, I wanna give,
I want to find another way to live.
Another shout, another cry,
And the walls come tumbling down.

Don't you know there's no way out;
Your pain's your own,
And the more we scream and shout
The more we feel alone.
I can feel my anger rising-
Am I to blame?
And I'm not gonna keep it inside me.
Do you feel the same?

I wanna love, I wanna give,
I want to find another way to live.
Another shout, another cry,
And the walls come tumbling down.
And I'm calling you.


YES LYRICS - Where Will You Be




Where will you be when you're not here.
How many lives in this earth time.
You are my soul and this you are.
Two should intertwined,
That's what we are.

We can, we walk, hand in hand,
All the life,
Be the one, everything to me;
You, I am dreaming.
We have lived and known before,
I feel it.

Where will you lie.

When will I know when you are gone.
Where I be, and I will miss you.
We are this love in this life,
Two should intertwined like once before.
See this meeting, hand in hand,
Every life,
Be the one, everything to me;
You are my feeling.

No need to fear this love of life,
We are the truth of every earth life.
No need to fear this life at all,
We are the sun and everlasting life.
Where will you be hearing this song.
How many lives in this earth time.
You are my soul and this you are.
You are my soul and this you are.

Where will you lie


YES LYRICS - Endless Dream




Hold your head up high you know you've
Come a long way, a long way
Tainted as a fugitive with nothing left to say
Temptation may come hope your vision doesn't stray
In the name of God you may be forced away

Moving forward to the only place you know
Side tracked by some indiscretion
Changing as you go
Temptation may come hope your
Conscience doesn't hide
The longest trip you'll take is inside

It's the last time telling myself everything
Call me over then bring me back again
It's the last chance telling myself
That I believe
Your forever is mine and all I need

Now life tell me now in your arms
All I really need is you by my side
I sing this to you all the world and all it is
I bring this to you this gift of love

And the world turns and the world turns
Time tells all we know we look to it
Jesus on the radio
Pledge me what you got I'll give you
Eternal resting spot
How intense I pray depends on how much you pay

It's the last time getting it this life
First calling in a silent spring
It's the first time getting it this life
First calling in a silent spring
Fear strikes deeper than visionary
Screams and tears never justify this love

Talk talk listening
Like the first words ever to reach out
Talk talk
Like the first sounds in a silent spring
Talk talk listening
Like the first words ever to reach out to you
Talk talk
Like the first sound you start to sing

So take your time
Look round and see
The most in time is where you're meant to be
For they talk too loud
And take the hope and peace from your heart
We call this surrender
Slowly towards the north
And this endless dream giving ourselves everything
We're deserving we're gonna bring it back again
It's the last time telling myself everything
It's the last time bring me back bring me back again
When the world brings you down
You can search you inside
For the love you will find (bring me back home)
When the world brings you down
You can search you inside
When the world brings you down
I've waited so long
When the world brings you down
You gotta play this living game
When the world brings you down
So take your time
Look round and see
The most in time is where you're meant to be
For you are light
Inside your dreams
For you will find that it's something
That touches me
