YES LYRICS - The Revealing Science Of God




The Revealing Science of God can be seen as an ever-opening
flower in which simple truths emerge examining the complexities and
magic of the past and how we should not forget the song that has
been left to us to hear. The knowledge of God is a search, constant
and clear.

Dawn of light lying between a silence and sold sources,
Chased amid fusions of wonder, in moments hardly seen forgotten,
Coloured in pastures of chance dancing leaves cast spells of challenge,
Amused but real in thought, we fled from the sea whole.
Dawn of thought transfered through moments of days underseaarching earth
Revelaing corridors of time provoking memories, disjointed but with purpose,
Craving penetrations offer links with the self instructors sharp
And tender love as we took to the air, a picture of distance.
Dawn of our power we amuse redescending as fast as misused
Expression, as only to teach love as to reveal passion chasing
Late into corners, and we danced from the ocean.
Dawn of love sent within us colours of awakening among the many
Won't to follow, only tunes of a different age.
As the links span our endless caresses for the freedom of life everlasting.

Talk to the sunlight caller
Soft summer mover distance mine.

Called out a tune but I never saw the face
Heard but not replaced
I ventured to talk, but I never lost my place
Cast out a spell rendered for the light of day
Lost in lights array
I ventured to see, as the sound began to play

What happened to this song we once knew so well
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell
I must have waited all my life for this
Moment moment

The future poised with the splendour just begun
The light we were as one
And crowded through the curtains of liquid into sun

And for a moment when our world had filled the skies
Magic turned our eyes
To feast on the treasure set for our strange device

What happened to wonders we once knew so well
Did we forget what happened surely we can tell
We must have waited all our lives for this
Moment moment moment

Starlight, movement, reasons
Release forward
Tallest rainbow
Sun shower seasons
Life flower reasons

They move fast, they tell me,
But I just can't believe that I can feel it
There's someone to tell you,
Amid the challenge we look around in unison with you

Getting over overhanging trees
Let them rape the forest
Thoughts would send our fusion
Clearly to be home

Getting over wars we do not mean
Or so it seems so clearly
Sheltered with our passion
Clearly to be home
They move fast, they tell me,
But I just can't believe they really mean to
There's someone, to tell you,
And I just can't believe our song will leave you
Skyline teacher
Warland seeker
Send out poison
Cast iron leader

And through the rhythm of moving slowly
Sent through the rhythm work out the story
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past.
Young christians see if from the beginning
Old people feel it, that's what they're saying.
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past.

They move fast, they tell me,
But I just can't believe they really mean to.
There's someone, to tell you
Acourse towards a universal season.

Getting over overhanging trees
Let them rape the forest
They might stand and leave them
Clearly to be home
Getting over wars we do not mean
We charm the movement suffers
Call out all our memories
Clearly to be home

We've moved fast
We need love
A part we offer is our only freedom

What happened to this song we once knew so well
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell
We must have waited all our lives for this
Moment moment

Past present movers moments we'll process the future, but only
through him we know send flowered rainbows
Apiece apart chased flowers of the dark and lights of songs to
follow and show all we feel for and know of
Cast round
You seekers of the truth accepting that reason will relive and
breath and hope and chase and love
For you and you and you.


YES LYRICS - The Remembering: High The Memory




The Remembering. All our thoughts, impressions, knowledge,
fears, have been developing for millions of years. What we can
relate to is our own past, our own life, our own history. Here, it
is especially Rick's keyboards which bring alive the ebb and flow
and depth of our mind's eye; the topographic ocean. Hopefully we
should appreciate that given points in time are not so significant
as the nature of what is impressed on the mind, and how it is retained and used.

As the silence of seasons on we relive abridge sails afloat
As to call light the soul shall sing of the velvet sailors course on
Of the velvet sailors course on
Shine or moons send me memories trail over days of forgotten tales
Course the compass to offer into a time that we've all seen on
Into a time that we've all seen on

High the memory carry on
While the moments start to linger
Sail away among your dreams
The strength regains us in between our time
The strength regains us in between our time
As we shall speak to differ also the ends meet the river's son
So the ends meet the river's son

Ours the story shall we carry on
And search the forest of the sun
We dream as we dream! Dream as one
And I do think very well
That the son might take you silently
They move fast
They tell me
There's someone rainbow
Alternate tune

In the days of summers so long
We danced as evenings sang their song
We wander out the days so long
And I do feel very well
That the evenings take you
Silently. They move round
Sunlight, seeing ground
Whispers of clay
Alternate ways

Softer messages bringing light to a truth long forgotten on
As we shall speak to differ also the ends meet the river's son
So the ends meet the river's son

I reach over and the fruit of life stand still
Stand awhile we search our past we start anew
The music sings of love you knew We walk around the story
Out in the city running free
Sands of companions sides that be
The strength of the meeting lies with you
Wait all the more regard your past
School gates remind us of our class
Chase all confusion away with us

Stand on hills of long forgotten yesterdays
Pass amongst your memories told returning ways
As certain as we walk today
We walk around the story
Out in the city running free
Days pass as seconds turn they key
The strength of the moment lies with you

Don the cap and close your eyes imagine all the glorious challenge
Iron metal cast to others
Distant drums

Force the bit between the mouth of freedom didn't we learn to fly
Remember to sail the skies
Distant suns
Will we reach
Wiunds allow
Other skylines
Other skylines to hold you

Relayer
All the dying cried before you
Relayer
We've rejoiced in all their meaining
Relayer
We advance we retrace our stories

Like a dreamer all our lives are only lost begotten changes
We relive in seagull's pages
Outwards ways.

Things are all in colours and the size of others shall send you
forward
Arrange to sail you toward
A peace of mind
Will we reach
Winds allow
Other skylines
Other skylines to hold you

Relayer
All the passion spent on one cross
Relayer
Sail the futile wars they suffer
Relayer
We advance we retrace our story, fail safe now

Stand on hills of long forgotten yesterdays
Pass amongst your memories told returning ways
As certain as we walk today
Press over moments leaving you
Out in the city running free
Days pass as seconds turn the key
The strength of the moment lies with you
Out tender outward lights of you
Shine over mountains make the view
The strength of you seeing lies with you

Ours entrance we surely carry on
And change the passing of the sun
We don't even need to try we are one

And I do think very well
As the truth unflods you
Silently
They move time
Rainbows
Sunlight
Alternate tune
Alternate tune

Rainbows
Soft light
Alternate view
Sunlight
Tell me
Someone
Alternate view
Alternate view, surely, surely


YES LYRICS - The Ancient: Giants Under The Sun




The Ancient probes still further into the past beyound the
point of remembering. Here Steve's guitar is pivotal in sharpening
reflection on the beauties and treasures of lots civilisations,
Indian, Chinese, Central American, Atlantean. These and other people
left an immense treasure of knowledge.

As one with the knowledge and magic of the source
Attuned to the majesty of music
They marched as one with earth

Sol, Dhoop
Sun
Ilios
Naytheet
Ah Kin
Saule
Tonatiuh
Qurax
Gunes, Grian
Surie
Ir
Samse

So the flowering creativity of life wove its web face to face with
the shallow
And their gods sought out and conquered
Ah Kin

Do the leaves of green stay greener through the autumn
Does the colour of the sun turn crimson white
Does a shadow come between us in the winter
Is the movement really light

And I heard a million voices singing
Acting to the story that they had heard about
Does one child know the secret and can say it
Or does it all come out along without you
along without you
along without you

Where does reaon stop and killing just take over
Does a lamb cry out before we shoot it dead
Are there many more in comfort understanding
Is the movement in the head

And I heard a million voices singing
Acting to the story that they had heard about
Does one child know the secret and can say it
Or does it all come out along without you
along without you
along without you


YES LYRICS - Ritual: Nous Sommes Du Soleil




The ritual seven notes of freedom to learn and to know the ritual
of life. Life is a fight between sources of evil and pure love.
Alan and Chris present and relay the struggle out of which comes a positive source.
Nous sommes du soleil. We are of the sun. We can see.

Nous sommes du soleil. We love when we play.
Nous sommes du soleil. We love when we play.
Open doors we find our way
We look we see we smile
Surely daybreaks cross our path
And stay maybe a while

Let them run, let them chase
Let them hid between
Constant doors will open eyes
As life seems like
Life seems like a
Fight, fight, fight

Maybe I'll just sing awhile
And then give you a call
Maybe I'll just say hello
And say maybe that's all
Hurry home as love is true
Will help us through the night

Till we're coming home again
Our life seems like
Life seems like a
Fight, fight, fight

Catch as we look and use the passions that flow
As we try continue
We receive all we venture to give

Maybe we'll just stand awhile
And surely we can call
Dreams are said to blossom courage
Constant to the soul

Change we must as surely time does
Changes call the course
Held inside we enter daybreaks
Asking for asking for
The source
The source
The source
Sent as we sing our music's total retain

As we try and consider
We receive all we venture to give
All we say is our
Soul constant sight listener
We won't tender our song clearer
Till we sail
Then I will be there
And I will be there
As clearer companions
Shall call to be near you
They move around tell me that
Move around surely sing
As they don't seem to matter at all
At all at all ...

Hold me my love, hold me today, call me round
Travel we say, wander we choose, love tune
Lay upon me, hold me around lasting hours
We love when we play

We hear a sound and alter our returning
We drift the shadows and course our way on home
Flying home
Going home

Look me my love sentences move dancing away
We join we receive
As our song memories long hope in a way
Nous sommes du soleil
Hold me around lasting ours
We love when we play
Nous sommes du soleil
Nous sommes du soleil
Nous sommes du soleil
