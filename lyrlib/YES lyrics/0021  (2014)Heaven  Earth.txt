YES LYRICS - Believe Again




So I climbed to the height of a mountain line
Is there a vision here
Woven to touch
And all to capture light?
Surely the stream of consciousness
Flows to the sea
Where drifting I found
That I can be
I’m really getting to know the empty space
Beneath the surface of common days
 
There I knelt at the foot of an open sky
Is it by faith, not time
The sun does climb
To light the path for us?
And I can embrace where I’m going
Tomorrow has already found me
 
I used to believe in a love watching over
I want to believe in that love yet again
I lost my touch to handle with kid gloves
In the rough game of push and shove
I lost sight
I used to believe in your love
To be believed in
Once more tonight
 
Will you speak to me fathers?
Grant me the words
That one day I’ll be called to speak
And finally I am here understanding
The clear and constant page
Despite the shroud of material ways
Where dreaming the sound
A new found freedom
 
I used to believe in a love watching over
I want to believe in that love yet again
If you lose your touch to handle with kid gloves
In the hard game of push and shove
Don’t lose sight
You can still receive the love
To be believed in
Once more tonight
 
Surely this dream of consciousness
Flows to the sea
Where drifting I found
That I can be
I’m really getting to know the empty space
Beneath the surface of common days
Where dreaming the sound
A new found freedom
 
I used to believe in a love watching over
I want to believe in that love yet again
If it all comes down to push and shove
Remember to lift your heart above the fight
You can still receive the love
To be believed in
 
To turn wrong to right
Beyond all the pain and the strife
Ride the turning tide
Lift a strength deep inside
We can transform wrong to right
 
We can still receive the love
To be believed in
Once more tonight


YES LYRICS - The Game




We all know the rules, the game
Us fools, still we play the same
As if our days remain
Our lives, the end will validate
It’s more to do than to say
The love we gave along the way

Through fleeting days and all that greys
It’s times like these as true love stays
I always knew through thick and thin
It’s here that I’d begin again

I’m standing here
At your door
With all my defenses down

We all know the rules, the game
Us fools, still we play the same
As if our days remain
Our lives, the end will validate
It’s more to do than to say
What we gave along the way
The big picture we now engage
Our scenes here set on the stage terrestrial

Reversing the flow
Here to grow
We’re all rehearsing, you know
Come the final fade out

We all know the rules, the game
Us fools, still we play the same
As if our days remain
Our lives, the end will validate
It’s more to do than to say
What we gave along the way

Through Fleeting days and all that greys
It’s times like these as true love stays
I always knew through thick and thin
It’s here that I’d begin again

I’m standing here
At your door
With all my defenses down

We all know the rules, the game
Us fools, still we play the same
As if our days remain
Our lives, the end will validate
It’s more to do than to say
What we gave along the way


YES LYRICS - Step Beyond




You told me so
If I don’t let go
I’d never know
The joy freedom brings

I told you so
As the grass will grow
Turn your hand
Back to the land

As the sun will shine
In the moon’s decline
There’s a truth to hear
So open wide

If your mind is still
There’s no bitter pill
When you reach
When you reach that hill

Beg, steal, rob, run, hide
Beg, steal, no disguise

Take one step beyond
One step beyond

Why such resistance
To reach out from behind our walls?
Elevated pride leads to a fall
We settle for small, blind identity
Forgetting all that we truly are
Get up off that shelf
Make the bold, the brave leap
outside yourself
Beyond…

You told me so
If I don’t let go
I’d never know
The joy freedom brings
I told you so
As the grass will grow
Turn your hand
Back to the land

As the sun will shine
In the moon’s decline
There’s a truth to hear
So open wide
If your mind is still
There’s no bitter pill
When you reach
When you reach that hill

Beg, steal, rob, run, hide
Beg, steal, no disguise

Take one step beyond
One step beyond
Beyond…


YES LYRICS - To Ascend




Were you drifting
On a strange tide?
Collecting visions
From the other side?
Caught between day and night
You were stealing moments past hours
of your life
And balancing on
The edge of a knife

Memories of once longer days
They keep on flooding back
The adventurous times when we
traveled life’s road
Though we were often blind
But with a lot more heart
And for each other
Taking the time

On a wing and a prayer
A wounded bird in the hand
With the eyes of a child
Come to understand
I will open the book
Raise the pen
Let it reinvent
My life again
Take me from where I am
As a freed bird
Flies from the hand
To ascend, to ascend

Were you catching
The last train to nowhere?
Playing out scenes
Of dark desert days?
Put it behind you now
Call out those bleak shadows from your mind
And never again
Slip through the cracks

Memories of once longer days
They keep on flooding back
The adventurous times when we
traveled life’s road
Though we were often blind
But with a lot more heart
And for each other
Taking the time

On a wing and a prayer
A wounded bird in the hand
With the eyes of a child
Come to understand
I will open the book
Raise the pen
Let it reinvent
My life again
Take me from where I am
As a freed bird
Flies from the hand
To ascend, to ascend


YES LYRICS - In A World Of Our Own




What’s wrong with a new revolution?
Who’s playing God on any given day?
Why put yourself through so much pressure?
Here we go again

Where were you when I needed you?
I was caught up in a crazy whirlwind
Then I saw your face in the crowd
You were somebody else then
Somebody else then

Why must you always lie to me?
One big mistake
We’re headed for heartbreak
You can whet your appetite anywhere
As long as you do
Your cooking at home
Right back where it began
Why can’t we be like we were then?
Living in a world of our own
In a world of our own

What’s right about a false evolution?
Must be lonely playing God all the while
‘Bout time you hail a taxi for that ego
You’re in a world all your own
In a world all your own

Your bleeding heart case made the headlines
Tomorrow lining every waste bin
You had to go and reinvent the rainy day
I was left out in the cold then
Stuck out in the rain again

Why must you always lie to me?
I know, for sure
You’re gonna reap what you sow
You can whet your appetite anywhere
As long as you do
Your cooking at home
Right back where it began
Why can’t we be like we were then?
Living in a world of our own
In a world of our own


YES LYRICS - Light Of The Ages




A beacon is shining
‘Cross the cosmos, it’s guiding
Igniting the pathway for us
Through the winter of our lives
A faithful polestar arises
Within every heart
The courage to advance
Passed our plight at this stage is
The light of the ages

When troubles lay me low
As fierce winds blow
Turn my gaze beyond
To ride the inbound stream
There grace and mercy shine
And fear is a dream
Sorrow’s a dream

When darkness holds me down
And trials abound
Lift my gaze within
I’ll heed the primal sound
Exposing the grand scheme
I can see it’s a dream
Sorrow’s a dream

And a beacon is shining
‘Cross the cosmos, it’s guiding
Igniting the pathway for us
Through the winter of our lives
A faithful polestar arises
Within every heart
The courage to advance
Passed our plight at this stage is
The light of the ages

I will follow the all knowing
Ever glowing light
Through my soul’s long dark night

When darkness holds me down
And trials abound
Lift my gaze within
I’ll heed the primal sound
Exposing the grand scheme
I can see it’s a dream

And a beacon is shining
‘Cross the cosmos, it’s guiding
Igniting the pathway for us
Through the winter of our lives
A faithful polestar arises
Within every mind
The power to transcend
To perceive passed thought cages
The light of the ages
The light of the ages
I will follow
The light of the ages
Through my soul’s long dark night


YES LYRICS - It Was All We Knew




Knowing too much
Where the river might end up
After the windy road of
Misadventure

Feeling the wasting
Ideas, evaporating
Alone, still together
In mind and in spirit

Sweet we're the fruits
Long were the summer days
It was all we knew

Time to reflect
Better days to resolve
That is by no means
Favour or coincidence

Sweet were the fruits
Long were the Summer days
It was all we knew

Everything's so easy
Didn't have to ask
Why we're here

Sweet were the fruits
Long were the summer days
It was all we knew
All we knew
All we knew


YES LYRICS - Subway Walls




Life road, metaphysical
Journey existential
Or any way in between
Writings in our sacred halls
Mysteries unsolved
Like the ever changing tide
Versions of the truth rise and fall

Is there meaning in the stars
Or does graffiti on some subway wall
Hold the secrets to it all?
We fear it’s just too far
Past the safe and small identity
Of who we think we are
Is the answer in the stars?

One glimpse, way out
Of the ethereal
Electric revelation
Or just imagination
Venturing to find
The victory of game
It’s all a state of mind

Is there meaning in the stars
Or does graffiti on some subway wall
Hold secrets to it all?
We fear it’s just too far
Past the safe and small identity
Of who we think we are
Is the answer in the stars?

If the answer’s in the stars
Then the writings in our sacred halls
Hold purpose after all
True calling in the stars
Beyond the safe, the small identity
Of who we dream we are
An answer near, not far
Life meanings in the stars

Oh, wounded sparrow of my heart
Your time has come
So soon will you mend
All windows open to you now
Doubt falls away
Rise and transcend

Brave the battle that’s before you
Trans send
Brave the battle that’s before you
Trance end

As in the stories of how the ancients
From forests took flight


YES LYRICS - Abilene




Something's goin' on, I don't know what it is
But my phone just rang and I didn't get no call
No call, just waiting here
Abilene, it's got a lot of what you don't need
It's got lots of space, still nothing seems misplaced
You've got a face, you are spacey

You got to take it as it comes to you
Don't need no act of contemplation
Just keep it off your wasteful way for now
It's not you who has got to change
It's not your way at all, it's got to be you

It's got to be you, the look in your eyes
The feel of your body close to me
It's got to be you
Who tells me the world would spin away without love
You, reason, oh, reason for being once more together
It's got to be you

It's got to be you, the look in your eyes
The feel of your body close to me
It's got to be you
Who tells me the world would spin away without love
You, reason, oh, reason for being once more together
It's got to be you

It's got to be you
It's got to be you
It's got to be you


YES LYRICS - Amazing Grace




Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
and mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun.


YES LYRICS - Dear Father




You need them to open the seed
To see what goes on in the world
Here in my mind
Catch the wind and hold on tight
To what we'll find
And hear what goes on in the world
Here is all you see
Everything is made for you from me

If there's anything you'd like to say that could help me in any way
Cause I've been waiting for so long for you to come along
Help me on that day
When you take over all the things heaven has made for you
Is there anything you think you should know
Is there anything before I go?

Dear Father [repeat]
I'm hungry, I'm cold
Feeling terribly old
I don't think I can see
I'm not feeling good like I think I should

They're on their own, needing a face, a place,
Hope and mind, a home
To see what goes on in the world
They're who you need
To show them why they're wrong, oh why indeed
We need to go on in the world
Here is all you see
Everything is made for you from me.

If there's any complication that you'd like to talk over with me about
'Cause I've been waiting for so long for you to come along
We can work it all out

[repeat pre-chorus]

Dear Father [repeat]
You must be putting me on
'Cause most of their minds are gone
They run on T'understand me
I'm not feeling good like I think I should

Dear Father [repeat]
Can I give it a miss
'Cause I'm not ready for this
I don't think I can see
I'm not feeling good like I think I should

Dear Father [repeat]
Won't you leave me alone
Won't you let me go home
I don't think I could see
Lord, they'd crucify me
I just couldn't do that
'Cause that's not where it's at now.


YES LYRICS - Make It Easy




Why the eagle flies
When the wind blows in his eyes
And he goes nowhere just to feel good

You don't know the reason
Our love is like the seasons
Breaking down and building up again

Why you hold me up
When I feel like falling down
Is the love you have that makes me feel good

Ah, you make it easy, take it slow
Well, I was hurtin' inside and you gave me a second chance
Ah, you take it easy when you let it go
I was hurtin' inside

Time rides all alone
When you're left back on your own
But I know, you're always there to lean on

Look beyond your [?]
And you'll find my love in check
It's all the love I have, love I give to you

Ah, you make it easy, take it slow
Well, I was hurtin' inside and you gave me a second chance
Ah, you take it easy when you let it go
I was hurtin' inside

Why the eagle flies
When the wind blows in his eyes
And he goes nowhere just to feel good

Time rides all alone
When you're left back on your own
But I know you're always there to lean on

You don't know the reasons
Our love is like the seasons
Breaking down and building up again

Ah, you make it easy, take it slow
Well, I was hurtin' inside and you gave me a second chance
Ah, you take it easy, when you let it go
I was hurtin' inside

Ah, you make it easy, take it slow
Well, I was hurtin' inside and you gave me a second chance
Ah, you take it easy when you let it go
I was hurtin' inside


YES LYRICS - Money




Money high, money low
Money come , money go.
'don't worry me
'don't worry me

(money don't buy)

The things that we like, the things that we love
The things that we have, so high above
Don't bother me
(it doesn't even matter to you)
Don't bother me
(money doesn't grow on trees)
Just don't worry!

Now listen!

Suns do shine, moons do glow
Simplicity everyone knows
Don't hurry me
(i'm in the middle of a dream)
Don't hurry me
(it's not at all the way it seems)

Now!

Money so high, money so low
Money to count, money to go
It won't be there where I go
(where is that you're going to? )
It won't be there where I go
(where is that you're going to? )

Just won't be there
No way!

(...screw anything you can... and i'm trying
To do that with the country...)

Do wop...
Da da da...


YES LYRICS - Picasso




Portrait a man of the past
Future secured by the stroke of a brush
Curled around the warm feel of the paint
That he trusted so well
Set seal on the artist's reply
Relayed through the portrait
Assessed through the language
Of love and emotion, it's true
So Picasso lies still, lies still

Distance, confusion attained
Relies on the artist to sign all the portions
As neatly as facts of clay
That were started so well
And so you may find the recluse
As busy as days that beset him to paint
All the sorrow and pain
And the future and wars, sad but true
So Picasso lies still, lies still lies still


YES LYRICS - Soon




Soon, oh soon the light
Pass within and soothe this endless night
And wait here for you
Our reason to be here

Soon, oh soon the time
All we move to gain will reach and calm
Our heart is open
Our reason to be here

Long ago, set into rhyme

Soon, oh soon the light
Ours to shape for all time, ours the right
The sun will lead us
Our reason to be here

Soon, oh soon the light
Ours to shape for all time, ours the right
The sun will lead us
Our reason to be here


YES LYRICS - Total Mass Retain




I get up, I get down
Now that it's all over and done
Now that you find, now that you hold

My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love
It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above
I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand
There’s you, the time, the logic or the reasons we don’t understand

Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see
As armored movers took approached to overlook the sea
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be

Down at the edge, close by a river
Close to the edge, round by the corner
Close to the end, down by the corner
Down at the edge, round by the river

Sudden caution shouldn’t take away the startled memory
All in all, the journey takes you all the way
As apart from any reality that you’ve ever seen and known
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention

Passing paths that climb halfway into the void
As we cross from the side to side
We hear the total mass retain

Down at the edge, round by the corner
Close to the end, down by a river
Seasons will pass you by
Get up, get down
