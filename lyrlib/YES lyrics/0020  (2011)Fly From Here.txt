YES LYRICS - Fly From Here - Pt I - We Can Fly




Along the edge of this airfield
The old prop-shaft airliners stand
Altimeters reading zero
Formless memories lingering

Nights are cold on this airfield
I sit alone and watch the radar
Locked on the wavelength, caught in the beam
Falling slowly into the screen

Every day that you wait
Is one more that you've lost
When you wake up
I see you there
On display
Lights the final point of no return
Taking us there from here

And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
Into a sky that's clearing
Look back we'll dry the tears
For those once held so nearly
And love will never disappear

Along the edge of this airfield
The old prop-shaft airliners stand
Altimeters reading zero
Formless memories lingering
Lingering, lingering, lingering

And we can fly from here
Into a sky so clearly
Look back, we'll dry the tears
For those once held so nearly

And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)

And we can fly from here
On the understanding that we can fly

Everyday that you waste
Is one more that you've lost
On display
That's a final point of no return

Everyday that you waste
Is one more that you've lost
On display
That's a final point of no return


YES LYRICS - Fly From Here - Pt II - Sad Night At The Airfield




There are no ground staff in the empty corridors
Is no one sleeping?
No one awake?

I'd start an engine in the night
If only just to break the silence
That last intake of...
Air...

The clouds in the night as we breathe
Too late for even the night breathes to me

We can wait for dawn
To carry on
Then we can fly from here

I want to be the one
Who always gives you shelter
Finds you waitin'
Keep you warm

I want to be the one
Who's always there beside you
But we both must
Face the dawn...
Alone...

So cruel like the world that we leave
Too late for even the night breathes to me

We can wait for dawn
To carry on
Then we can fly from here

Only ghosts are in the empty corridors
They're all strangers
Never cared

I know them from some other life
When things were different
And we both were in the end

Turn yourself around (turn yourself around)
Turn your life around (turn your life around)
Turn your world around (turn your world around)
Turn this ship around (turn this ship around)

So turn your wheel around
I watch the sky

All defenses down
I watch the sky
I watch the sky


YES LYRICS - Fly From Here - Pt III - Madman At The Screens




Take a table
In the evening
By the waterside

Lonely eyes watch
As the moon shines
Down a silver tine

Looking out from this position
Are things what they seem?

It's been spreading out from
One decision
Into this bad dream

Out on the shoreline (shoreline)
Someone is waiting (waiting)
Wind that was falling is rising again

I hear the voices (voices)
I hear them calling (calling)
Every song was singing in the rain

Sailor, sailor beware
There are storm clouds
You must take care
Easy bring her around
Or the night will
Run you aground

I know...

In the ceiling
Over our heads
Fans and moving air
Spinning out the
Hours of darkness
Warning sound somewhere

Out on the shoreline (shoreline)
Someone is waiting (waiting)
The wind that was falling is rising again
I hear the voices (voices)
I hear them calling (calling)
Every song was singing in the rain

Sailor, sailor beware
There are storm clouds
You must take care
Easy bring her around
Or the night will
Run you aground

Morning
Here in the air
When you feel it
Know that you're there

Laying dark
Behind the scenes a
Madman at the screens

Laying dark
Behind the scenes a
Madman at the screens

Laying dark
Behind the scenes a
Madman at the screens

Dreaming...
Feeling the air...
Dreaming...
Seeing you there...


YES LYRICS - Fly From Here - Pt IV - Bumpy Ride




Dreaming
Seeing you there
See you sometime somewhere


YES LYRICS - Fly From Here - Pt V - We Can Fly (Reprise)




We can fly (we can fly)
We can fly (we can fly)

And we can fly from here
Into the sky that's clearing
Look back we'll dry the tears
For those once held so nearly

And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here

On the understanding that we can fly


YES LYRICS - The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be




What have I become?
What am I runnin' away from?
I used to see
Things in a very different way

What am I to do?
I have changed my point of view
I was lost
Now I've found myself in you

From some other part of me
I'll summon the strength to see me through
From deep in the heart of me
To be anything you want me to

And that's when I start to be
The man you've always seen in me
The man you always wanted me to be

What have we become?
What are we running away from?
We need to see
Life in a very different way

Learning what to do
After all that we've been through
No longer lost
We have found ourselves anew

From some other part of me
I'll summon the strength to see me through
From deep in the heart of me
To be anything you want me to

And that's when I start to be
The man you've always seen in me
The man you always wanted me to be

Ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
Ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
Ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah

The man you always wanted me to be
The man you always wanted me to be

Ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
Ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
Ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah


YES LYRICS - Life On A Film Set




All the poems of my neighbors
That drift across the sand
Are just the tendrils of a vast
But gentle pluck which they command

The headdress of a goddess
You wore the night we came
Is only one small symptom
And really not to blame

You're riding a tiger
Riding a tiger

Heaven sent immortals
Waged upon the wall
And likewise all the missiles
Shot to make them fall

Everlasting movie
Picture into frame

Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger

All of the beaches
Into the sky
Into the beach of sun-glass goodbye

Key grip was crying
This boy was made
Here in the shelter
Whole unafraid
We were there

Follow the road that leads to the sun
Who formed our leader he is the one
Who will offer the silence
You must beware
Using the page that no one can share

Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger

Out of the morning
Into the day
Onto the evening
Nowhere to stay

We were always together
Always the same
Into the future
No one to blame

Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger


YES LYRICS - Hour Of Need




In the dark while the obvious isn't clear
Can't believe just what can interfere

Remember what has been achieved
Keep tryin' it's the hour of need

What's the cost?
Can the end justify the means?
There's a need so many mouths to feed

Remember what has been achieved
Keep tryin' it's the hour of need
Still hoping we can succeed
In this hour of need

Words unwritten
Mistrust suspicion
Stuck in this wilderness

For everyone water to drink
Either we sink or swim


YES LYRICS - Into The Storm




Something not so superficial
Like something I can really do without
Need a hand to hold onto
Help me understand

What's the point of reparation now?
You've just got to make that beat somehow
Into the storm

All the stories you've been telling
You must know someday they'll find you out
Through this life you've been propelling
Now you're spinning out

Time to make your reparations now
You've just got to make that leap somehow
Come on and make it now
Into the storm

Armies of angels are starting to fall
Bathed in the light at the break of the dawn
Armies of angels are leading me on
Take me away from the heart of the storm
Take me away
Take me away

One thing learned from all these years
As stupid now as we were at first
Maybe that's the way it goes
When you try to change the world

Sending pointless invitations out
You always knew what this was all about
Somewhere a fire is breaking out
Into the storm

Armies of angels are starting to fall
Bathed in the light at the break of the dawn
Armies of angels are leading me on
Take me away from the heart of the storm
Take me away
Take me away

And we can fly from here
And we can fly from here
And we can fly from here
And we can fly from here
