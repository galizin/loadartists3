YES LYRICS - Beyond And Before




Sparkling trees of Silver foam
cast shadows soft in winter's home
Swaying branches breaking sound
In lonely forests trembling ground.

Masquerading leaves of blue
Run circles round the morning dew
In patterns understood by you
Reaching out beyond and before

Time like gold dust brings mind down
To levels hidden underground
Say a few words to the wind
That's all thats left of winters friend.

Reaching the snow
In the days of the cold
Casting a Spell out of Ice
Now that your gone
the summers too long
and it seems like the end of my life
Reaching out beyond and before

Time like gold dust brings mind down
Time like gold dust brings mind down


YES LYRICS - I See You




I see you la la la la la la I see you
I see you la la la la la la I see you
I see you la la la la la la I see you
Sun smiling through the cave of your hair
Wind washing tulips out of space sitting there
I love you
At your door second floor first world war
I love you
Who listens
tell your friend I'm aware that she care
who listens
Green specks bright spiraling out in the sky
catch my eye turn my head have to look don't know why
I see you
Everywhere behind your hair over there
I see you
I see you though your eyes can tell lies I sympathize,
I see you
Sun smiling through the cave of your hair
Wind washing tulips out of space sitting there
I love you
At your door second floor first world war
I love you
I see you,
Everywhere behind your hair over there
I see you
I see you though your eyes can tell lies I sympathize
I see you
I love you,
I love you at your door second floor first world war
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you


YES LYRICS - Yesterday And Today




Why is there you,
When there are few,
People making me feel good.
Why is there me,
When air is free,
Some I can see better than I should,
There's only us,
simply because,
Thinking of us makes us both happy
I think of you everyway, yesterday and today,
I think of things we do all the way everyday
Stand in the sea
sing songs for me,
Sing happily making me feel good,
Watching your eyes,
Feeling your sighs,
saying goodbyes better than I could,
There's only us,
simply because,
Thinking of us makes us both happy
I think of you everyway yesterday and today,
I think of nothing but you things we do, things we do.


YES LYRICS - Looking Around




Looking around me
There's not so much in life that I miss
Things that I can't see
I'll touch and I'll feel then I'll kiss
Then I saw you standing there
With a smile I couldn't share
Just looking around, everywhere.
Tunes that I can't hear,
would take me for a while my smile
Fares that are too dear
I'd rather walk out another smile
Then I heard a tune so right
It was in the light of night
just listening around everywhere
All the things I've wanted to do
take so much time to get around to you
just reach out and catch and hold on
having trails of dust and lust but never even lying or trying
just keep on moving and never dying.
Smiles that I don't see
I'll make them up as I go on
Laughs that just can't be
I'll make and laugh at everyone
Then I saw you in your place
with a laugh upon your face
Just looking around everywhere
Looking around with my feet on the ground full of words and
of sound bring smiles all around
Satisfy me with your words that can be full of sound and I'll
see I'm just looking around.


YES LYRICS - Harold Land




Harold Land with a wave of his hand,
said goodbye to all that,
He paid his bills, stopped the Milk, and then put on his hat,
He tried to say his last farewells as quickly as he could,
Promising that he would return, but doubted that he would,
doubted that he would.

Now he's marching soldiers in the rain
as on to war they rode.
A long thin line of human mind,
damnation as their load!
In the mud in coldness dark he'd shiver out his fear,
What disappointing sights he'd seen instead of one's so dear
instead of one's so dear

Going home, He's going home to the land he loved so well,
Going home, he fought for two whole years he never fell,
He's going home, He's going home.
Harold Land with a wave of his hand stood sadly on the stage,
Clutching red ribbons from a badge but he didn't look his age,
only two years had passed between his leaving home and back,
He had lost his love and youth while leading the attack
Leading the attack

In conversation it could be said,
Well after war your heart is dead,
Well it's not hard to understand,
There is no heart in Harold Land.


YES LYRICS - Every Little Thing




When I'm walking beside her,
people tell me I'm lucky
Yes I know I'm a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
can't stop thinking about her now
Every little thing she does
she does for me yeah
and you know the things she does
she does for me
When I'm with her I'm happy
Just to know that she loves me
Yes I know that she love me now
there is one thing I am sure of
because I know love will never die


YES LYRICS - Sweetness




She brings the sunshine to a rainy afternoon
She puts the sweetness in and stirs it with a spoon,
She watches for my moods and never brings me down
She puts the sweetness in all around
She knows just what to say to make me feel so good inside
and when I'm all alone I feel I don't want to hide
Today she bought me in and told me where she'd been
She put my mind at rest and put the sweetness in
I'll ask her for some time to go and look around
She puts the sweetness in all around
She knows just what to say to make a sunny day
And when I'm all alone I really don't feel that way.
Tell me how would you feel with no world of your own
and nobody to hold, I just can't see the way
I'm so glad it's today and you're here.


YES LYRICS - Survival




Sunshine is creeping in and somewhere in a field a life begins,
An egg too proud to rape the beginning of a shape of things to come,
That starts the run, life has begun, fly fast the gun.
The Mother flew too late and life within the egg was left to fate,
not really knowing how the world outside would take it when it came,
and life's the same for things we aim, are we to blame?
Don't doubt the fact that there's life within you,
yesterday's endings will tomorrow's life give you,
all that dies, dies for a reason,
to put its strength into the Season,
Survival, Survival,
They take away as we give,
The livings right to live,
the livings right to know.
The egg breaks all is out, the crawling bird begins to scream and shout,
Where is the parent bird, a loneliness arose and heard its name-
ring in for life begins, survival win, survivals sin.
So soon the evening comes with it runs the aching
fear of hate could Someone still remain who thinks he
still could gain by escaping fate? it's much too late,
don't underrate, appreciate.
And we're all going
And we're all going
And we're all going somewhere!
