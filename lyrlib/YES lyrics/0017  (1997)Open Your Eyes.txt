YES LYRICS - New State Of Mind




Waiting for the moment when the moment has been waiting all the time 
Staring at the golden heights, wondering are you ready for the climb
Are you ready for this?     
If you're ready to believe it, treasure you'll find
Are you ready for that?     
Don't mistake the chance, focus your eyes
Will you take the chance?   
When you're ready to receive it, fear's left behind
Well you've got the time?   
A new perspective
A new state of mind

Always on the edge of what could be the greatest moment in this life 
Watching as the theme builds, left only to wonder in delight
You've got to let it go                         
You've got to let yourself believe in all that can be
Wanting to feel 
Wanting to feel just what it means to be free
There's no reason for deceiving 
There's no reason for deceiving, focus your eyes
To a new perspective 
A new state of mind

Sometimes you feel you want to run away from it all 
Sometimes you hear the voices of the past come to call 
But there's no giving up when you are giving it your all
Hoping, forgiving and loving, the qualities of life 
Designing the future we're building, the dreams taking flight
Are you ready for love?
....

A new state of mind
Waiting for the moment when the moment has been waiting all the time 
Reaching for the golden heights without a doubt you're ready for the climb
You've got to set it out                                                  
You've got to set yourself believing and fortunes you'll find
No escaping                                                                                
No escaping once you've made up your mind
There's a reason for your being                                               
There's a reason for your being, focus your eyes
To a new perspective 
A new state of mind


YES LYRICS - Open Your Eyes




You've got a great imagination

You carry on in the same old way
No lessons learned from yesterday

Talk of changes lost in pages of paperwork

I believe it...
How can we refuse to see
I've received it...
What could be our final destiny
I believe that...
Still we go on from day to day 
Knowing what could be true

Wish I knew
Wish I knew
Wish I knew

Open your eyes and discover
You're not the only one
In disguise
Do you wonder
When the change is gonna come?

Open your eyes

You've got a great imagination

We cast the world, we set the stage
For what could be the darkest age

Short exchanges
From perfect strangers
We'll never know
But wish we knew

I believe it...
It's time to face reality
I've received it...
Questioning the powers that be
I believe it...
Are we too confused to see?

Wish I knew
Wish I knew
Wish I knew
Wish I knew

Open your eyes and discover
You're not the only one
In disguise
Do you wonder
When the change is gonna come?

Open your eyes
You've got a great imagination
Open your eyes
Show it
Show it

Wish we knew

I believe it...
It's time to face reality
I've received it...
Things aren't what they used to be
I believe it...
What I see in you, you see in me

Wish I knew
Wish I knew
Wish I knew
Wish I knew

Open your eyes and discover
You're not the only one
In disguise
Do you wonder
When the change is gonna come?

Change is gonna come
Change is gonna come
Change is gonna come
You've got a great imagination

Change is gonna come
Change is gonna come
Change is gonna come
You've got a sweet imagination

Change is gonna come
Open your eyes
Change is gonna come
Open your eyes
Change is gonna come
You've got a deep imagination coming

Show it
Show it
Show it

Show it
Show it
Show it


YES LYRICS - Universal Garden




Looking up into the endless sky
Staring into the maze of time
Our existance caught in the blink of an eye
Imagining other words we try
Realizing somehow we're all part of this
Wondrous cosmical tapestry

Beyond the sun
Beyond the sky
Are where the real questions lie
Wanting to know where it begins
The puzzle piece we are missing

Starlight
Flowering
Endlessly through the universal garden
Garden above

Looking up into the endless sky
Through space and time
Staring into the maze of time
We'll fly
Our existence caught in the blink of an eye
Retracing years
Imagining other worlds we try
No fears
Realizing somehow we're all part of this
Blazing a new trail
Wondrous cosmical tapestry

Beyond the sun
Beyond the sky
Are where the real questions lie

Wanting to know where it begins
The puzzle piece we are missing

Starlight
Flowering
Endlessly through the universal garden
Garden above

Investigate the science of illusion
We benefit without knowing

Our time is man-made
Our fear is man-made
Delusion man-made
Religion man-made

Love is forever
Flowering
Endlessly through the universal garden
Garden above

Beyond the sun
Beyond the sky
Are where the real questions lie
Wanting to know where it begins
The puzzle piece we are missing

Beyond the sun
Beyond the sky
Are where the real questions lie

Universal garden


YES LYRICS - No Way We Can Lose




There can be no answer for us all
There can be no stopping what is ever changing
Living for the perfect dream
It's time to make a resolution
There will be some peace in our hearts and our minds

We can all find a way to resolve our differences
There's no way we can lose
When we all realize that there are no differences
There's no way we can lose

Ready or not
We can all find a way

We will be forgiving to the ones we love
We will see the blossoming of the new spirit
Shaping everything to our design
We'll build a brighter future
We will free ourselves from the chains that would bind

We can all find a way to resolve our differences
There's no way we can lose
When we all realize that there are no differences
There's no way we can lose
No way we can lose

Ready or not
Ready or not
There's no way we can lose

We can all find a way
Ready or not
Ready or not

We can all find a way to resolve our differences
There's no way we can lose
When we all realize that there are no differences
There's no way we can lose
No way we can lose

Ready or not
Ready or not
Ready or not

No way we can lose

YES LYRICS - Man In The Moon




I am the man in the moon
And I hope to shine upon you very soon
Waiting in the night 
To bathe you all in moonlight
I am the man
I am the man in the moon

Silently revolving 
Wandering through the heavens above 
On my own

Round and round and round I go
When I stop no one will know

I am a creature of the night
And I hope to come and shed a little light
Although the universe our teacher 
I remain the central feature
I am the man
I am the man in the moon

Round and round and round I go
When I stop no one will know

Silently revolving 
Wandering through the heavens above 
On my own

I am the man in the moon


YES LYRICS - Wonderlove




I believed that one day love would cast a line
I believed there was something more for me to find
Hoping today
Hoping tomorrow
Taking it all in stride
I believed
I could be chasing my mind

There you were
Like a dream to me
Wonderlove
Could this really be
Wonderlove
Can I make you see
You're the world to me

I believe if only we could take the time
Eventually we would learn each other's life
Open your heart
Give it a moment
Leaving the cares behind
Happily
We could be two of a kind

There you were
Like a dream to me
Wonderlove
We were meant to be
Wonderlove
Can I make you see
You're the world to me

It was the very next day that I came alive
The door flung open
There was a vision
Couldn't believe my eyes
Everyone immortal like as though they didn't get it
Everyone believing here at last receiving
Wonderlove
It's a place we all belong
Wonderlove

Wonderlove
Can I make you see 
You're my world 

I believe I could walk a thousand miles
Just to see the vision of your simple smile
Everyday
Wanting to follow
Forever by your side
Faithfully
You are my destiny

There you were
Wonderlove
We were meant to be
Wonderlove
It's the world where we belong
Wonderlove
Together we will faithfully
Wonderlove
Can I make you see 
You're the world to me

Just imagine what you give is who you are and where you're going to
If you're looking for the wisdom of the world
All you've got to do is let it coming through
Be forever

Just imagine
Wonderlove


YES LYRICS - From The Balcony




Now I've heard you singing
Dreaming that you know me well
Let me tell you far away
Looking down on you

If you know my spirit
Always shall you know me now
Singing is your pleasure
Looking down on you

Now I hear you singing
Saying that you know me well
Take me to your promise
New state of mind

Now I feel you sighing
Saying that you understand
Feeling all the power
Looking down on you

You know that I would be
The one who waits forever
You know that someday we will find
A way to share our love

Now I hear you singing
Dreaming that you know me well
Let me tell you far away
New state of mind


YES LYRICS - Love Shine




I won't sleep again until I sleep again with you 
I won't dream again until I dream again with you

One look in your eyes and I see the light shining through 
I truly believe in the magic of all that you do

Give me hope.....When I need it
Give me peace.....When I feel it
Give me life.....When I breathe it
Give me dreams....Keep me dreaming

One look in your eyes and I know it's right for me and you
Feel the love shine.....Do you feel the love shine.....

Your flame is the fire that bums in the night guiding me
through
Drawn out of the darkness and into the light you bring me to
Give me hope......When I need it
Give me peace.....When I feel it
Give me life.....When I breathe it
Give me dreams......Keep me dreaming

One look in your eyes and I know it's right for me and you

Do you feel the love shine......Feel the love that shines
I won't dream again until I dream again with you
1234567 all good people got to feel the love

I won't sleep again until I sleep again with you
One chance in a million to find a true love between two 
Taken by the powers of what you believe knowing you can't lose
Give me hope......When I need it
Give me peace......When I feel it
Give me life.......When I breathe it
Give me dreams.....Keep me dreaming

One look in your eyes and I know it's right for me and you

Do you feel the love shine......Feel the love that shines
I won't dream again until I dream again with you I won't sleep again until 1234567

It was the first time candlelight, something happens in
your life
It's the dance we all go through, bring it in now, bring it in
true, bring it in fast
Bring it right through right through
Feel the love shine


YES LYRICS - Somehow, Someday




So the blue bird will fly o'er the world and the stars
In the moonlight she prays for forgiveness that's ours
Only now can she rest from the singing of songs
And the freedom of love

Chances are when you give the love you have
You will find it coming right back
Giving into the love, you know it's right
It's a feeling you'll long remember

Hearts will be chosen.... 
Somehow Someday... 
Hearts will be chosen

Sailing into the dreams of what could be
Reaching out for some form of contact
Waiting for the one you know is right
All you're needing to do, surrender

Someday.....

Hearts will be chosen
Somehow......Someday

Hearts will be chosen

So many times on the clouds of forgiveness
We walk through the country and feel so at ease
A gentle reminder how things really are
In our homelands of love

Face to face with the one you really love
Moving forward down the right track
Chances are when you give all that you have
You will find it flooding right back

Someday.....
Hearts will be chosen
Somehow......Someday
Hearts will be chosen

O'er the green mountains and o'er the green valleys
The blue bird of faith sails far off to the shore
She sleeps on the breeze of the coming of love
For the homelands of Ireland

So many times on the clouds of forgiveness
We walk through the country and feel so at ease
A gentle reminder how things really are
In our homelands of love

So the blue bird will fly o'er the world and the stars
In the moonlight she prays for forgiveness that's ours
Only now can she rest from the singing of songs
And the freedom of love


YES LYRICS - The Solution




No need to wonder "do you belong?"
No need to worry, you can be strong
Don't disbelieve it, let your fears go
There must be more to this life and we all know...

Deep inside ... the solution, staring you down
Looking for ... the solution, bringing you round
Round and round we go

The past can haunt your future so
Shadows are falling, look out below
Voices are calling echoes unknown
There must be more to this life than we all know...

Looking for ... the solution, staring you down
Deep inside ... the solution, bringing you round

Giving in, giving out, do the best you can do
Giving in, giving out, it's all up to you
Giving in, giving out, do the best you can do
Giving in, giving out, it's all up to you

Over and under and down we go
(Down we go)
Caught at the crossroads, "Which way to go?"
(Path unknown)
Choosing the right path? Only you know...

Looking for ... The solution, you hold the key
Deep inside ... The solution, set yourself free
Round and round we go, round and round we go

Giving in, giving out, do the best you can do
Giving in, giving out, it's all up to you
It's all up to you
It's all up to you
