[I Your Move]

I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way
I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way

Take a straight and stronger course to the corner of your life
Make the white queen run so fast she hasn't got time to make you a wife

'Cause it's time is time in time with your time and
It's news is captured... for the queen to use!
Move me on to any black square
Use me anytime you want
Just remember that the goal
Is for us all to capture all we want
(Move me on to any black square)

Don't surround yourself with yourself
Move on back two squares
Send an instant comment to me
Initial it with loving care
(Don't surround yourself)

'Cause it's time is time in time with your time and
It's news is captured... for the queen to use!

Diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit didda
Diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit didda
(Don't surround yourself with yourself)

Don't surround yourself with yourself
(Don't surround yourself)
Move on back two squares
Send an instant comment to me
(Send an instant comment to me)
Initial it with loving care
(Don't surround yourself)

'Cause it's time is time in time with your time and
It's news is captured... for the queen to use!

Diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit didda (Is give peace a chance)

YES LYRICS - Going For The One




Get the idea
Cross around the track
When you leap on the flank 
Of a thoroughbred racing chaser

Get the feel 
As the rhythm flows
Would you like to go 
And shoot the mountain masses?

And here you stand no taller than the grass seas
And should you really chase so hard
The truth of sport plays rings around you

Going for the one
Going for the one

Get in the way 
As the tons of water
Racing with you 
Crash into the rudders
Once at the start 
Can you gamble that
You really surely 
Really mean to finish

After seeing all your sense of fear diminish
As you treat danger as a pure connection
As you throw away all misconceptions

Going for the one
Going for the one
Going for-ward to

Listen in time
Taken so high
To touch, to move
Listen to life

Touching, touch time
Travel, twilight
Taken so high
Roundabout, sounding out
Love me so

Now the verses I've sang 
Don't add much weight 
To the story in my head
So I'm thinking I should go and write a punchline

But they're so hard to find 
In my cosmic mind
So I think I'll take 
A look out of the window

When I think about you
I don't feel low
Should I really chase so hard?
The truth of sport plays rings around you

Going for the one
Going for the one
Going for-ward to 

Listen in time
Taken so high
To touch, to move
Listen to life

Touching, touch time
Travel, twilight
Taken so high
Taking your time

Turn on to love
Turnstile to one
Tender timing
Rocking, rolling

Listen in time
Taken so high
To touch, to move
Listen to life

Touching, touch time
Travel, twilight
Taken so high
Taking your time

Turn on to love
Turnstile to one
Tender timing
Rocking, rolling

Turn on to love
Turnstile to one
Tender timing
Rocking, rolling

Moments decide...
Moments delight...
Moments invite...
Talk about sending love...
Love...
Love...
Love...
Love


YES LYRICS - Time And A Word




In the morning when you rise,
Do you open up your eyes, see what I see?
Do you see the same things ev'ry day?
Do you think of a way to start the day
Getting things in proportion?
Spread the news and help the world go 'round.
Have you heard of a time that will help us get it together again?
Have you heard of the word that will stop us going wrong?
Well, the time is near and the word you'll hear
When you get things in perspective.
Spread the news and help the word go round.

There's a time and the time is now and it's right for me,
It's right for me, and the time is now.
There's a word and the word is love and it's right for me,
It's right for me, and the word is love.

Have you heard of a time that will help get it together again?
Have you heard of the word that will stop us going wrong?
Well, the time is near and the word you'll hear
When you get things in perspective.
Spread the news and help the word go round.

There's a time and the time is now and it's right for me,
It's right for me, and the time is now.
There's a word and the word is love and it's right for me,
It's right for me, and the word is love.
There's a time and the time is now and it's right for me,
It's right for me, and the time is now.
There's a word and the word is love and it's right for me,
It's right for me, and the word is love.


YES LYRICS - Close To The Edge




[I  The Solid Time Of Change]

A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace
And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace
And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar
And taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour
And assessing points to nowhere, leading every single one
A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun
And take away the plain in which we move
And choose the course you're running

Down at the end, round by the corner
Not right away, not right away
Close to the edge, down by a river
Not right away, not right away

Crossed the line around the changes of the summer
Reaching out to call the color of the sky
Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see
Getting over all the time I had to worry
Leaving all the changes far from far behind
We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name

Down at the end, round by the corner
Close to the edge, just by a river
Seasons will pass you by
I get up, I get down
Now that it's all over and done
Now that you find, now that you're whole

[II  Total Mass Retain]

My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love
It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above
I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand
There's you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we don't understand

Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see
As armoured movers took approached to overlook the sea
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be

Down at the edge, close by a river
Close to the edge, round by the corner
Close to the end, down by the corner
Down at the edge, round by the river

Sudden cause shouldn't take away the startled memory
All in all, the journey takes you all the way
As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void
As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain

Down at the edge, round by the corner
Close to the end, down by a river
Seasons will pass you by
I get up, I get down

[III  I Get Up, I Get Down]

In her white lace, you could clearly see the lady sadly looking
Saying that she'd take the blame
For the crucifixion of her own domain

I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down

Two million people barely satisfy
Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late
The eyes of honesty can achieve
(She would gladly say it amazement of her story)
How many millions do we deceive each day?
(Asking only interest could be layed upon the children of her domain)

I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down

In charge of who is there in charge of me
(She could clearly see the lady sadly looking)
Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?
(Saying that she'd take the blame
For the crucifixion of her own domain)
The truth is written all along the page
(She would gladly say it amazement of her story)
How old will I be before I come of age for you?
(Asking only interest could be layed upon the children of her domain)

I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down

I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down

[IV  Seasons Of Man]

The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes
A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, so it seems
And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love
As song and chance develop time, lost social temp'rance rules above
Ah, ah

Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space
He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race
I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place
On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley
Called to witness cycles only of the past
And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark

Close to the edge, down by the river
Down at the end, round by the corner
Seasons will pass you by
Now that it's all over and done
Called to the seed, right to the sun
Now that you find, now that you're whole
Seasons will pass you by

I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down


YES LYRICS - Turn Of The Century




Realising a form out of stone,
Set hands moving. 
Roan shaped his heart,
Through his working hands. 
Worked to mold his passion into clay, 
Like the sun. 

In his room, his lady,
She would dance and sing so completely. 
"So be still," he now cries,
"I have time, oh let clay transform thee so." 

In the deep cold of night, 
Winter calls, he cries "Don't deny me!" 
For his lady, deep her illness. 
Time has caught her,
And will for all reasons take her. 

In the still light of dawn, she dies. 
Helpless hands soul revealing. 

Like leaves we touch, we learn. 
We once knew the story. 
As winter calls he will starve,
All but to see the stone be life.

Now Roan, no more tears. 
Set to work his strength,
So transformed him.
Realizing a form out of stone,
His work so absorbed him.

Could she hear him? 
Could she see him? 
All aglow was his room,
Dazed in this light. 
He would touch her,
He would hold her.

Laughing as they danced,
Highest colors touching others. 

Did her eyes at the turn of the century,
Tell me plainly.
How we'll meet, how we'll love, 
Oh, let life so transform me. 

Like leaves we touch, we dance. 
We once knew the story. 
As autumn called and we both,
Remembered all those many years ago. 
I'm sure we know. 

Was the sign in the day with a touch,
As I kiss your fingers. 
We walk hands in the sun,
Memories when we're young, 
Love lingers so. 

Was it sun through the haze,
That made all your looks, 
As warm as moonlight? 
As a pearl deep your eyes, 
Tears have flown away, 
All the same light. 

Did her eyes at the turn of the century,
Tell me plainly.
When we meet, how we'll look, 
As we smile time will leave me clearly. 

Like leaves we touch, we see,
We will know the story. 
As autumn calls we'll both remember,
All those many years ago.


YES LYRICS - And You And I




[I Cord Of Life]

A man conceived a moment's answer to the dream
Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes
As a foundation left to create the spiral aim
A movement regained and regarded both the same
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you

Changed only for a sight of sound, the space agreed
Between the picture of time behind the face of need
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
Emotions revealed as the ocean maid
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you

Coins and crosses
(Turn round tailor, assaulting)
Never know their fruitless worth
(all the mornings of the interest shown,
presenting one another to the cord)
Cords are broken
(All left dying, rediscovered
Of the door that turned round)
Locked inside the mother Earth
(To close the cover, all the
interest shown)
They won't hide, hold, they won't tell you
(To turn one another, to the
sign at the time float your climb)
Watching the world, watching all of the world
Watching us go by

And you and I climb over the sea to the valley
And you and I reached out for reasons to call

[II Eclipse]

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
Emotions revealed as the ocean maid
As a movement regained and regarded both the same
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you

[III The Preacher, The Teacher]

Sad preacher nailed upon the coloured door of time
Insane teacher be there reminded of the rhyme
There'll be no mutant enemy we shall certify
Political ends as sad remains will die
Reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you
Oooh, ooh

I listened hard but could not see
Life tempo change out and inside me
The preacher trained in all to lose his name
The teacher travels, asking to be shown the same
In the end we'll agree, we'll accept, we'll immortalize
That the truth of man maturing in his eyes
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
As a moment regained and regarded both the same
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid
A clearer future, morning, evening, nights with you

[IV Apocalypse]

And you and I climb, crossing the shapes of the morning
And you and I reach over the sun for the river
And you and I climb, clearer towards the movement
And you and I called over valleys of endless seas


YES LYRICS - Mind Drive




Don't forget to seek out the world that you want to stake out
Actions speak much louder than words
And you get to realize 
Just as long as you have control, holding the fire
Just as long as you keep control, this point of your desire
Wait as it will all come to you
Feel it as a mutual response
You get the heaven you like
You get the heaven
You get the heaven you need
You get to heaven now
Just as long as you bring the power from the inside
Just as long as you hold the key from the inside
Ascend and create
Ascend and create
Ascension

They will bring you rain
They will move the sky
They will give you light
It will live you long
Thru' the eyes of child
Through the song of songs
It will bring the moon 
It will transfer you
Whole, pushing for the time to call
Dancing on the moon, giving it out

In the night of nights
It will shine for you
With the wings of flight
They will make it thru'
Through the eyes of child and the test of song
It will comfort you 
It will make you feel
Whole, looking for the chance to call
Making your world, independently
Whole, watching for the place to run
Dancing, dancing, move

We will make it right 
We will dance for you
On this night of nights
They will make it thru'
Through the eyes of child and the wish you are
As the thought that comes from a distant star
Whatever thought you have
Can become a new dream
For the perfect stance
Take you there and back again
And you believe you are
Independently, Whole
Waiting for the signs, Whole
Reaching for the foresight shown 
Whole, dancing for the moon, dancing for the light
Whole, pushing for the mind drive, drive
Dancing for the Earth, dancing for the light
Whole
Dancing for the light

They will bring the rain
They will make it right
It will transfer you, each and every night
With their wings of hope, they will cover you
They will make it right, they will shine for you
With their golden wings, close around your soul
It will count for you, it will make you whole
Thru' the eyes of child, and the song of songs
It will make you move, it will transfer you

And so it comes to this now
When you walk into the bliss that
Holds down the fire 
As pleasure will devine
So close so let your heart enter
So come and let your heart enter this
So close and let yourself lose control
Heaven help the love that you send
Heaven has the love you send, free

Whole, watching for the time to call
Dancing in the light, making it right
Dancing, dancing, whole
Waiting for the signs, whole
Reaching for the sight to show
Whole, independently, whole
Pushing for the mind drive, drive
Dancing on the Earth, dancing in the light

They will bring the rain, they will shine the light
Understanding this, it can come tonight
For the love of love and the answers to
It begins with me, it begins with you
Whole, pushing for the time to call
Looking for the sign, making it right
Dancing, dancing, whole
Waiting for the time to call
Dancing in the harmless sun
Entering the mind drive

Don't forget to seek out the world that you want to stake out
Actions speak much louder than words
And you get to realise 
Just as long as you have control, holding the fire
Just as long as you get to keep, this point of your desire
Wait as it will come to you
Feel it as a mutual response
You get the heaven you like
You get to heaven
You get the heaven you need
You get to heaven now

My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world
My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world

My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world
My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world

Looking for the mystery in the woman
Dancing with the teacher in the circle
Watching for the reasons we are going
Getting ready for the big bang
Everybody looking for that great connection
Somebody help me find that universal dream
Everybody watching, is something happening
See what I mean

Looking for the real man
Looking for the teacher
Dancing with the circle
Looking for the real world
Everybody knows where we're going to
Don't forget to leave good footprints behind
Never let the grass grow over your soul
Only time will tell, leave good footprints behind

I have seen the way 
The way is clear to save your love
High upon the sky
The forces come to break you free

Forgiving is what you have
Forgiving is what you see
Forgiving is what you know
Forgiving is all you are
I have seen the way
The way is clear beyond your soul

I have seen the way 
The way is clear to save your love
High upon the sky
The forces come to break you free
Forgiving is what you have
Forgiving is what you see
They say the soul has so many lifetimes
My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world

Only when you stop to listen
Only when you stop to see
Forgiving is what you have
Forgiving is what you see
Forgiving is what you know
Forgiving is all you are

My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world
My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world

Don't forget to leave good footprints behind
Don't forget to leave good footprints behind


YES LYRICS - Bring Me To The Power




This state in the matrix of the real world thinking
This way is meant to surface through the 'net
This train is set to mystify
This day in the history of the future
This train is set to justify
Whether you're ready or not
This day is of the meeting now

If they don't give us the keys how are we supposed to get ready?
If they don't give us the keys how are we to survive?
Cover me up and bring me to the power
Cover me up and bring me to the power
Cover me up and bring me to the power

All I know is all I want to give you

Cover me up get closer to the fire
Cover me up get closer to the power
Cover me up get closer to the power
Cover me up get closer now
Cover me up get closer to the power

God talk
God talk, now, talk
God talk
Give a little-ation
God talk, revelation
God talk, revelation

If they don't give 'em the keys
If we don't give 'em the keys
How are they supposed to be ready
If we don't give 'em the keys
How are they to divine
If we don't give 'em the keys
How are they supposed to be ready
If we don't give 'em the keys
How are they to survive
Cover me up and bring me to the power
Cover me up and bring me revelation

If we don't give 'em the keys
How are they supposed to be ready
If you don't give 'em the keys
How are they to survive
The power of love can open every heart in everyone
Minute by minute...........

[A) Children Of Light]

Distant as the distant thunder
Where equal rights for (will) rent assunder
Equal rights for equal people
(this) disregard for love's equality

Bringing back the signs to no-man's land
Where diamonds and gold in hand
Will barter as the homeless burn
Someday will it be our turn? 

Why this consciousness this desire
To expand the flame of revolution
With a (the) gothic hand in (of) fire persecution
Blood-letting and (in) spinning pain? 

Why this hungry media delivering
Questions answers blessed forgivers (plus forgive us)
Millions of racial inequalities
We all are one
All are sacred

Be the birth of a nation
Stop this aggravation
So uninspired
And (to) question man's inhumanity
And lack of love for his cosmic god

Children of light don't be afraid
Children of light haven't you heard
Gone are the days in black and white
Children of light don't be afraid

Distant as the distant thunder
Where equal rights for (will) rent assunder
Equal rights for equal people
(this) disregard for love's equality

Bringing back the signs to no-man's land
Where diamonds and gold in hand
Will barter as the homeless burn
Someday will it be our turn? 

Someday will it be our turn? 
Someday will it be our turn? 

Children of light don't be afraid
Children of light haven't you heard
Gone are the days in black and white
Children of light don't be afraid
