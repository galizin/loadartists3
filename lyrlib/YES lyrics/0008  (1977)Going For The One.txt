YES LYRICS - Going For The One




Get the idea
Cross around the track
When you leap on the flank 
Of a thoroughbred racing chaser

Get the feel 
As the rhythm flows
Would you like to go 
And shoot the mountain masses?

And here you stand no taller than the grass seas
And should you really chase so hard
The truth of sport plays rings around you

Going for the one
Going for the one

Get in the way 
As the tons of water
Racing with you 
Crash into the rudders
Once at the start 
Can you gamble that
You really surely 
Really mean to finish

After seeing all your sense of fear diminish
As you treat danger as a pure connection
As you throw away all misconceptions

Going for the one
Going for the one
Going for-ward to

Listen in time
Taken so high
To touch, to move
Listen to life

Touching, touch time
Travel, twilight
Taken so high
Roundabout, sounding out
Love me so

Now the verses I've sang 
Don't add much weight 
To the story in my head
So I'm thinking I should go and write a punchline

But they're so hard to find 
In my cosmic mind
So I think I'll take 
A look out of the window

When I think about you
I don't feel low
Should I really chase so hard?
The truth of sport plays rings around you

Going for the one
Going for the one
Going for-ward to 

Listen in time
Taken so high
To touch, to move
Listen to life

Touching, touch time
Travel, twilight
Taken so high
Taking your time

Turn on to love
Turnstile to one
Tender timing
Rocking, rolling

Listen in time
Taken so high
To touch, to move
Listen to life

Touching, touch time
Travel, twilight
Taken so high
Taking your time

Turn on to love
Turnstile to one
Tender timing
Rocking, rolling

Turn on to love
Turnstile to one
Tender timing
Rocking, rolling

Moments decide...
Moments delight...
Moments invite...
Talk about sending love...
Love...
Love...
Love...
Love


YES LYRICS - Turn Of The Century




Realising a form out of stone,
Set hands moving. 
Roan shaped his heart,
Through his working hands. 
Worked to mold his passion into clay, 
Like the sun. 

In his room, his lady,
She would dance and sing so completely. 
"So be still," he now cries,
"I have time, oh let clay transform thee so." 

In the deep cold of night, 
Winter calls, he cries "Don't deny me!" 
For his lady, deep her illness. 
Time has caught her,
And will for all reasons take her. 

In the still light of dawn, she dies. 
Helpless hands soul revealing. 

Like leaves we touch, we learn. 
We once knew the story. 
As winter calls he will starve,
All but to see the stone be life.

Now Roan, no more tears. 
Set to work his strength,
So transformed him.
Realizing a form out of stone,
His work so absorbed him.

Could she hear him? 
Could she see him? 
All aglow was his room,
Dazed in this light. 
He would touch her,
He would hold her.

Laughing as they danced,
Highest colors touching others. 

Did her eyes at the turn of the century,
Tell me plainly.
How we'll meet, how we'll love, 
Oh, let life so transform me. 

Like leaves we touch, we dance. 
We once knew the story. 
As autumn called and we both,
Remembered all those many years ago. 
I'm sure we know. 

Was the sign in the day with a touch,
As I kiss your fingers. 
We walk hands in the sun,
Memories when we're young, 
Love lingers so. 

Was it sun through the haze,
That made all your looks, 
As warm as moonlight? 
As a pearl deep your eyes, 
Tears have flown away, 
All the same light. 

Did her eyes at the turn of the century,
Tell me plainly.
When we meet, how we'll look, 
As we smile time will leave me clearly. 

Like leaves we touch, we see,
We will know the story. 
As autumn calls we'll both remember,
All those many years ago.


YES LYRICS - Parallels




When you've tried most everything and nothing's taking you higher
When you've come to realise, you've been playing with fire
Hear me when I say to you, it's really down to your heart

It's the beginning of a new love in sight
You've got the way to make it all happen
Set it spinning turning roundabout
Create a new dimension
When we are winning we can stop and shout
Making love towards perfection

I've been all around the world and seen so many faces
Young and old a story told, filling in my spaces
Now without a trace of doubt, I feel it every hour

It's the beginning of a new love inside
Could be an ever opening flower
No hesitation when we're all about
To build a shining tower
No explanations, need to work it out
You know we've got the power

Parallel our sights
And we will find, that we, we need, to be, where we, belong
Parallel our heights
Display our rights and wrongs, and always, keep it STRONG

It's the beginning of a new love in sight
Could be an ever opening flower
No explanations, need to work it out
You know we've got the power

It's the beginning of a new love inside
You've got the way to make it all happen
Set it spinning turning roundabout
Create a new dimension
When we are winning we can stop and shout
Making love towards perfection

YES LYRICS - Wonderous Stories




I awoke this morning
Love laid me down by the river
Drifting I turned on up stream
Bound for my forgiver
In the giving of my eyes to see your face
Sound did silence me
Leaving no trace
I beg to leave, to hear your wonderous stories
Beg to hear your wonderous stories 'LA AHA'

He spoke of lands not far
Nor lands they were in his mind
Of fusion captured high
Where reason captured his time
In no time at all he took me to the gate
In haste I quickly
Checked the time
If I was late
I had to leave, to hear your wonderous stories
Had to hear your wonderous stories 'LA AHA, LA AHA'

Hearing
Hearing hearing your wonderous stories
Hearing your wonderous stories
It is no lie I see deeply into the future
Imagine everything
You're close
And were you there
To stand so cautiously at first
And then so high
As he spoke my spirit climbed into the sky
I bid it to return
To hear your wonderous stories
Return to hear your wonderous stories
Return to hear your wonderous stories
LA AH LA AH AH AH

Hearing
Hearing
Hearing
Hearing

YES LYRICS - Awaken




High vibration go on 
To the sun
Oh, let my heart dreaming
Past a mortal as me
Where can I be?

Wish the sun to stand still
Reaching out to touch our all being
Past all mortal as we
Here we can be
(He can be here)
(Be here now)
Here we can be

Suns | High | Streams | Through
Awaken gentle mass touch
(Gentle mass touch)
Awaken gentle mass touch
(Gentle mass touch)

Strong | Dreams | Reign | Here
Awaken gentle mass touch
(Gentle mass touch)
Awaken gentle mass touch
(Gentle mass touch)
Awaken gentle mass touch

Star | Song | Age | Less
Awaken gentle mass touching
(Gentle mass touch)
Awaken gentle mass touching
(Gentle mass touch)
Awaken gentle mass touching
Touching...
Touching...
Touching...

Workings of man
Set to ply out historical life
Reregaining the flower of the fruit of his tree
All awakening
All restoring you 

Workings of man
Crying out from the fire set aflame
By his blindness to see 
That the warmth of his being
Is promised for his seeing 
His reaching so clearly 

Workings of man
Driven far from the path
Rereleased in inhibitions
So that all is left for you
All is left for you
All is left for you
All is left for you NOW... 

Master of images
Songs cast a light on you
Hark thru dark ties
That tunnel us out of sane existence
In challenge as direct
As eyes see young stars assemble 

Master of light
All pure chance
As exists cross divided
In all encircling mode
Oh closely guided plan
Awaken in our heart 

Master of soul
Set to touch
All impenetrable youth
Ask away
That thought be contact
With all that's clear
Be honest with yourself
There's no doubt 
No doubt 

Master of time
Setting sail
Over all our lands
And as we look
Forever closer
Shall we now bid
Farewell farewell... 

High vibration go on
To the sun, oh let my heart dreaming
Past a mortal as me
Where can I be 

Wish the sun to stand still
Reaching out to touch our own being
Past all mortal as we
Here we can be

Like the time I ran away
Turned around and you were standing close to me
Like the time I ran away
Turned around and you were standing close to me
