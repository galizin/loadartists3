YES LYRICS - Machine Messiah




[Part I]

Run down a street
Where the glass shows
That summer has gone
Age, in the doorways
Resenting the pace of the dawn.
All of them standing in line
All of them waiting for time.
From time, the great healer,
The machine-Messiah
Is born.

Cables that carry the life
To the cities we build
Threads that link diamonds of life
To the satanic mills
Ah, to see in every way
That we feel it every
Day, and know that
Maybe we'll change
Offered the chance
To finally unlearn our lessons
And alter our stance.

[Part II]

Friends make their way into systems of chance
[reply - friends make their way of escape into systems of chance]
Escape to freedom I need to be there
Waiting and watching, the tables are turning
I'm waiting and watching
I need to be there.

I care to see them walk away
And, to be there when they say
They will return.

Machine, Messiah
The mindless
Search for a higher
Controller
Take me to the fire
And hold me
Show me the strength of your
Singular eye.

[Part III]

History dictating symptoms of ruling romance
Claws at the shores of the water upon which we dance
All of us standing in line
All of us waiting for time
To feel it, all the way
And to be there when they
Say they know that
Maybe we'll change
Offered the chance
To finally unlearn our lessons
And alter our stance.

Machine, machine Messiah.
Take me into the fire

Hold me, machine Messiah
And show me
The strength of your singular eye.


YES LYRICS - White Car




I see a man in a white car
Move like a ghost on the skyline
Take all your dreams
And you throw them away
Man in a white car.


YES LYRICS - Does It Really Happen?




That's what you say
Does it really happen to you
Does that explain
This is the season for this display.
To take a look
In time to move together

[Chorus:]
Time is the measure before it's begun
Slips away like running water
Live for the pleasure, live by the gun
Heritage for sun and daughter
Down to the slaughter up for the fun
Up for anything.

Could this be true
Does it ever happen to you
And can you prove
That wheels go 'round in reason
You take a step
In time,
To move together

[Chorus]

You walk, the way
You take, the path
To be, assured
You draw, a graph
The scale, you use
Is all, on black
Be brave, the weight
Will make, the heat
There is, no way
To take-it back.

[Repeat chorus]


YES LYRICS - Into The Lens




Memories, how they fade so fast
Look back, that is no escape
Tied down, now you see too late.
Lovers, they will never wait.

I am a camera

Take heart, I could never let you go
And you, always let the feeling show
Love us all, how you never broke your heart
You lose them
If you feel the feeling start.

I am a camera, camera, camera

And you, may find time will blind you
This to just remind you
All is meant to be.

Here, by the waterside
There, where the lens is wide
You and me
By the sea
Taken in tranquility.

Taken, taken so easily
To pass into glass reality
Transform, to transfer, to energy.

Taken, taken, so easily
To pass into glass reality
Transformer, transferring energy.


YES LYRICS - Run Through The Light




I asked my love to give me shelter
And all she offered me were dreams
Of all the moments spent together
That move like never ending streams.

Run to the light
Everything is alright
Run thro' the light of day
You run to the light of night

And every movement made together
Till every thought was just the same
And all the pieces fit forever
In the game.

Welcome to the light
Now everything is okay
Run thro' the light of night
You run to the light of day.


YES LYRICS - Tempus Fugit




Born in the night
She would run like a leopard
That freaks at the sight
Of a mind close beside herself
And the nearer I came
How the country would change
She was using the landscape
To hide herself.

More in the mind
Than the body this feeling
A sense at the end
Of a circular line
That is drawn at an angle
I see when I'm with you
To navigate waters and finally answer to-yes.

If you were there you would want to be near me
Innocence, you could hold all the materials
And though nothing would really be living
It would shock Your fall into landing light
In the north sky time flies fast to the morning
The cold of the dawn it meant nothing to us
You were keeping your best situation
An answer to-yes

(Yes, Yes) And the moment I see you
(Yes, Yes) It's so good to be near you
(Yes, Yes) And the feeling you give me
(Yes, Yes) Makes me want to be with you
(Yes, Yes) From the moment you tell me - yes

If you could see all the roads I have travelled
Towards some unusable last equilibrium
Run like an athlete and die like a dead beaten speed-freak
An answer to all of your answers to-yes

In the north sky time flies faster than morning
The cold of the dawn it meant nothing to us
You were keeping your best situation
An answer to Yes

(Yes, Yes) And the moment I see you
(Yes, Yes) It's so good to be near you
(Yes, Yes) And the feeling you give me
(Yes, Yes) Makes me want to be with you
(Yes, Yes) If we wait for an answer
(Yes, Yes) Will the silence be broken
(Yes, Yes) Should we wait for an answer
(Yes, Yes) Do we leave it unspoken

(Yes Yes Yes Yes . . .)


YES LYRICS - Dancing Through The Light




Dance in the light. Dance in the light
Dance in the light. Dance in the light.  
     
Dance in the light. Everything is all right
Dance in the light of day, dance in the light of night.

Dance in the light. Dance in the light.    
Dance in the light. Dance in the light. 
           
Dance in the light. Dance in the light.                                                                   
Dance in the light. Everything is all right. 

Dance in the light of day, dance in the light of night. 

Ooh, let it go through. Oooh, here it comes
Oooh, here we go.
